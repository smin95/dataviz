You can type codes (commands) into the console (bottom-left panel). &gt; means that the console is ready to receive more code. + means your code is not complete. You can also write (longer) codes in the script within the code editor (top-left panel). The code editor will run the script into the console. A new script can be opened by clicking: File -&gt; New -&gt; R Script. You can run a script by clicking Run\" with the green arrow or by typing ctrl + enter. It is labeled with the red circle. Or you can just type your codes directly into the console.

First, you can type it in the script and run it after highlighting the codes you would like to run. Figure 1.3: How to run your code - script Second, you can type your code directly in the console. Figure 1.4: How to run your code - console 1.2 Basics of R Lets type some codes Capitalization, punctuations and brackets are all important. ' ' and \" \" mean the same. However, ' \" are not paired. So they will not work. = and &lt;- mean equivalent. I often use &lt;-. Type ? when you are not sure about the code (ex. ?t.test) A code becomes comment when it is preceded by #. Try typing # g = 3 and see if the number gets stored in g by typing g in the console. x = 3 # x equals to 3 a &lt;- 4 # a equals to 4 d &lt;- &#39;Group&#39; # gr is equal to a character &#39;Group&#39;, which is not a number. e &lt;- &quot;Group&quot; d == e # &#39;Group&#39; and &quot;Group&quot; are equal ## [1] TRUE # g = 3 # its a comment Notice that I used == to test if d and e are equal. Therefore, == and = mean different. == tests if two things are equal. = sets two things to be equal. d == e returns TRUE because they are both 'Group'. TRUE is equivalent to 1 numerically. Now lets check if x and a are equal. x == a ## [1] FALSE It returns FALSE because x and a are not equal. This is correct because 3 and 4 are not equal. FALSE equals to 0 numerically. Below are more examples showing that TRUE = 1 and FALSE = 0. TRUE + FALSE # 1 + 0 ## [1] 1 TRUE + TRUE # 1 + 1 ## [1] 2 FALSE + FALSE # 0 + 0 ## [1] 0 TRUE*2 # 1 * 2 ## [1] 2 TRUE*FALSE # 1 * 0 ## [1] 0 How can I learn most effectively with the notes? Dont just read it. Dont just copy and paste the codes and run them in RStudio (ctrl + c &amp; ctrl + p). Make sure you type each code. You can also change your code and see if it still works. If you are not sure of your code, you can type ? before the function. If you are still not sure after reading the notes, check out Chapter 3 of R for Data Science: https://r4ds.had.co.nz/ More installation R is an old programming language. So, people, such as statisticians and programmers, have created more functions in R in the form of the package to update the language. They are free but they have to be downloaded separately. A package can contain several functions. In this tutorial, you will mainly be using ggplot2 package, which is elegant and flexible for visualizing data. Also, you will be using smplot package. It improves ggplot2 graphs visually. So, you will need to install some packages, such as ggplot2 and smplot. Please type the codes below. install.packages(&#39;devtools&#39;) devtools::install_github(&#39;smin95/smplot&#39;) # requires VPN if you are in China You only need to install them once, but you will need to reload them whenever you start a new session in RStudio using the function library(). library(tidyverse) # it has ggplot2 package library(cowplot) # it allows you to save figures in .png file library(smplot) Now lets make some graphs in the subsequent chapters.

Question: Do cars with large engines use up more fuel than the those with small ones? Lets open mpg, which is a data frame stored in the ggplot2 package. mpg contains data about cars in the US. You can type ?mpg for more information. displ: the size of the cars engine in liters hwy: fuel efficiency.

You can type View(mpg) to see the entire data frame. Each row is an unique observation. Each column is an unique variable/condition. View(mpg) 2.2 Basics of ggplot2 Lets make some graphs Question: Do cars with large engines use up more fuel than the those with small ones? To answer our question, we need to plot mpg data. The x-axis should be displ, the y-axis should be hwy. ggplot(data = mpg) + geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) We find that a smaller car has a higher efficiency and that a larger car has a lower efficiency. In other words, we see a negative relationship. How ggplot works When you are making a graph with ggplot2, always begin by typing the function ggplot(). The data you want to plot is the first argument here. Ex. ggplot(data = mpg). However, ggplot(data = mpg) alone does not create a graph. You will need add (by typing +) more layers, such as geom_point(). geom_point() adds points to your graphs. You will need to specify (or map) x- and y-axes in the aes() function, which means aesthetics. This process is called mapping. As you might expect, there are other geom functions, such as geom_bar(), geom_boxplot(), geom_errorbar(). They plot bar graphs, boxplots and error bars, respectively. Here is the template for using ggplot2 (copied from R for Data Science). ggplot(data = &lt;DATA&gt;) + &lt;GEOM_FUNCTION&gt;(mapping = aes(&lt;MAPPINGS&gt;)) Different color of points for each unique group You can apply different colors by the class of each car (each car = each row of the mpg data frame). Include class variable in the aes() function. This maps the third variable class into your graph. aes() means aesthetic (ex. color, shape, etc). ggplot(data = mpg) + geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = class)) You can also set different shapes for each group of the data. ggplot(data = mpg) + geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, shape = class)) Or size or transparency (not recommended). But you get the idea. Using aes() in a geom function (ex. geom_point()), you can label different group of points. # different levels of transparency (alpha) for each group ggplot(data = mpg) + geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, alpha = class)) # different sizes of the points for each group ggplot(data = mpg) + geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, size = class)) Different color &amp; shape for each group You can also apply different color &amp; shape for each group of the data. Exercise: Try it on your own before you look at the code below. ggplot(data = mpg) + geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = class, shape = class)) Same shape across all groups So far, you have put variables such as shape and color inside the function aes(). This has enabled you to apply different shape and color for each group. If you put the variable for shape, color, size outside of aes() in the geom function, then all data points will have the specified shape, color, etc even if they are in different groups. ggplot(data = mpg) + geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = class), shape = 17) Notice that the color is different for each group because it is inside the function aes(). However, all the points are triangle because we have typed shape = 17 outside the function aes(). Exercise: try changing the shape of the points to the circle with the border. Figure 2.1: image from http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/ggplot2-point-shapes Exercise: try changing the shape of the points to the circle with the border. When shape = 19, the shape is the circle without the border. When shape = 20, the shape is the small circle without the border. When shape = 21, the shape is the circle with the border. So lets set shape to 21. ggplot(data = mpg) + geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = class), shape = 21) Notice that the border color is different for each group, but not the color that fills the circle. Shapes without their borders (15-20) are filled with color. Shapes with the border (21-24) are filled with fill and its border colored with color. So lets change color = Class to fill = Class. ggplot(data = mpg) + geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, fill = class), shape = 21) How do we draw the best-fit line of the graph? Here is our graph. ggplot(data = mpg) + geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) There seems to be a negative relationship. How do we draw the best-fit line of the graphs negative relationship? Use another geom function geom_smooth(). ggplot(data = mpg) + geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) ## `geom_smooth()` using method = &#39;loess&#39; and formula &#39;y ~ x&#39; geom_point() + geom_smooth() Now lets combine geom_point() + geom_smooth() into one graph. ggplot(data = mpg) + geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) ## `geom_smooth()` using method = &#39;loess&#39; and formula &#39;y ~ x&#39; ggplot() acts as a system where you can add multiple geom objects, such as geom_point() and geom_smooth(). You can add multiple layers of geom in a single plot, like shown here. ggplot() and at least one geom function are necessary to draw a graph. ggplot() alone does not draw a graph. Try it on your own. ggplot(data = mpg) Writing shorter codes ggplot(data = mpg) + geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) Notice that we have typed mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy) twice. This is repetitive. If you type the mapping argument in ggplot(), you wont need to type them anymore in the subsequent geom functions. ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth() ## `geom_smooth()` using method = &#39;loess&#39; and formula &#39;y ~ x&#39; This is exactly the same as the previous graph. In both cases, the mapping has been set so that the x-axis is displ and the y-axis is hwy in both geom_point() and geom_smooth(). Now lets apply different color of points and the fit the line for each group. ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = class)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth() ## `geom_smooth()` using method = &#39;loess&#39; and formula &#39;y ~ x&#39; Okay, this is extremely messy and probably a bad idea. You might have gotten warnings but you can usually ignore them. Lets plot the best-fit line across all groups (i.e., one best-fit line) but apply different color for each class (i.e., many colors). To do so, type color = class in geom_point, not ggplot(). This enables you to specify that you will apply different color for each class only in geom_point() but not in geom_smooth(). ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + geom_point(aes(color = class)) + geom_smooth() ## `geom_smooth()` using method = &#39;loess&#39; and formula &#39;y ~ x&#39; 2.3 Improve Data Visualization using smplot Although the default theme of ggplot2 graphs is clean, there are some things that I do not like: The fonts are too small. The grey background is distracting. There are too many grids. ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = class)) + geom_point() Lets make this graph prettier by using functions from smplot. In this example, lets use sm_corr_theme(). Ive made this function as a theme suitable for correlation plots. Disclaimer: smplot package has been built based on my preference. smplot is not necessary to make a ggplot graph or change its style. It is possible to change every aspect of the graph with ggplot2 but this requires about 8-20 lines of codes (based on my experience). Instead, smplot function does so in one line of code. ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = class)) + geom_point() + sm_corr_theme() Now lets remove the border within sm_corr_theme() by setting borders = FALSE. ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = class)) + geom_point() + sm_corr_theme(borders = FALSE) Exercise: You can also set borders = TRUE and see what happens. ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = class)) + geom_point() + sm_corr_theme(borders = TRUE) You might notice that borders come back. This is exactly what happens when you do not include borders argument in sm_corr_theme(). This is because sm_corr_theme() is set to borders = TRUE as default. I think the one with the border looks better. You can also remove the legend by setting legends = FALSE in sm_corr_theme(). ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = class)) + geom_point() + sm_corr_theme(legends = FALSE) Exercise Set legends = TRUE and see what happens. Type ?sm_corr_theme to see why legends appear without directly writing legends = TRUE. ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = class)) + geom_point() + sm_corr_theme(legends = TRUE) However, in this case, I think we need a legend because there are many classes. Positive relationship between x- and y-axes Lets plot another scatterplot using mtcars data. Set the x-axis with drat and y-axis with mpg. Since you are making a scatterplot, you will need to use geom_point(). Set the size of all points to 3 by typing size = 3. Set the shape of all points to the circle with a border by typing shape = 21. Set the filled color of all points to green by typing fill = '#0f993d'. Set the border color to white by typing color = 'white'. Since shape = 21 refers to the circle with a border, fill is the color that fills the points and color is the border color. ggplot(data = mtcars, mapping = aes(x = drat, y = mpg)) + geom_point(shape = 21, fill = &#39;#0f993d&#39;, color = &#39;white&#39;, size = 3) drat and mpg have a positive relationship. Now lets make it pretty by adding sm_corr_theme(). ggplot(data = mtcars, mapping = aes(x = drat, y = mpg)) + geom_point(shape = 21, fill = &#39;#0f993d&#39;, color = &#39;white&#39;, size = 3) + sm_corr_theme() You can remove borders too by setting borders = FALSE in sm_corr_theme(). ggplot(data = mtcars, mapping = aes(x = drat, y = mpg)) + geom_point(shape = 21, fill = &#39;#0f993d&#39;, color = &#39;white&#39;, size = 3) + sm_corr_theme(borders = FALSE) Reporting statistics from a paired correlation smplot also offers a function that plots the best-fit line of a scatterplot (i.e., correlation plot) and prints statistical values, such as p- and R-values. p-value is used to check for statistical significance. If its less than 0.05, its regarded as statistically significant. However, it gets smaller with a larger sample size. R-value (correlation coefficient) measures the strength and the direction of the correlation. It ranges from -1 to 1. It does not depend on the sample size. Lets add a function sm_statCorr(). The statistical results are from Pearsons correlation test. ggplot(data = mtcars, mapping = aes(x = drat, y = mpg)) + geom_point(shape = 21, fill = &#39;#0f993d&#39;, color = &#39;white&#39;, size = 3) + sm_corr_theme() + sm_statCorr() ## `geom_smooth()` using formula &#39;y ~ x&#39; I dont really like how the line color is different from that of the points. Lets change the color to green. Also lets get results from Spearmans correlation test rather than from Pearsons. To do so, type corr_method = 'spearman' in the function sm_statCorr(). You will get a different R value from 0.68, which is from Pearsons correlation test. ggplot(data = mtcars, mapping = aes(x = drat, y = mpg)) + geom_point(shape = 21, fill = &#39;#0f993d&#39;, color = &#39;white&#39;, size = 3) + sm_corr_theme() + sm_statCorr(color = &#39;#0f993d&#39;, corr_method = &#39;spearman&#39;) ## `geom_smooth()` using formula &#39;y ~ x&#39; Exercise: Set corr_method = 'pearson'and see what happens. ggplot(data = mtcars, aes(x = drat, y = mpg)) + geom_point(shape = 21, fill = &#39;#0f993d&#39;, color = &#39;white&#39;, size = 3) + sm_corr_theme() + sm_statCorr(color = &#39;#0f993d&#39;, corr_method = &#39;pearson&#39;) You will see that this is exactly the same as when corr_method argument is not included in sm_statCorr(). In short, the default correlation method for sm_statCorr() is 'pearson'. So, if you dont write anything for corr_method, it will give results from Pearsons correlation test. Type ?sm_statCorr to see the default of line_type. #0f993d is a specific green that I like. Now, lets change the color. Replace '#0f993d' with 'green' in geom_point() and sm_statCorr. This 'green' is the default green color of R. ggplot(data = mtcars, mapping = aes(x = drat, y = mpg)) + geom_point(shape = 21, fill = &#39;green&#39;, color = &#39;white&#39;, size = 3) + sm_corr_theme() + sm_statCorr(color = &#39;green&#39;) ## `geom_smooth()` using formula &#39;y ~ x&#39; Which one do you prefer? fill = '#0f993d' vs fill = 'green' I personally like #0f993d more. However, R does not recognize this color as green. So how are you supposed to remember the color code? You do not have to. You can type sm_color('green') instead. This is a function from the smplot package. sm_color() accepts the name of the color. If you want to get the hex codes (color codes) for red and green, type sm_color('red','green'). sm_color(&#39;red&#39;,&#39;green&#39;) Again, sm_color() has been built based on my preference. So it returns the hex codes of colors that I use most often. There are many more color themes that are available in R. For more information, please check out Chapter 28 of R for Data Science (https://r4ds.had.co.nz/graphics-for-communication.html). ggplot(data = mtcars, mapping = aes(x = drat, y = mpg)) + geom_point(shape = 21, fill = sm_color(&#39;green&#39;), color = &#39;white&#39;,size = 3) + sm_corr_theme() + sm_statCorr(color = sm_color(&#39;green&#39;)) ## `geom_smooth()` using formula &#39;y ~ x&#39; Exercise Change the color of the points and the best-fit line to blue using sm_color(). If you want to see all the color options for sm_color(), type ?sm_color. There are 16 colors total. ggplot(data = mtcars, mapping = aes(x = drat, y = mpg)) + geom_point(shape = 21, fill = sm_color(&#39;blue&#39;), color = &#39;white&#39;,size = 3) + sm_corr_theme() + sm_statCorr(color = sm_color(&#39;blue&#39;)) Different color for each group but with other colors Lets go back to the mpg data. Set the x-axis with displ and y-axis with hwy. Then make a scatterplot using geom_point(). Set the size of the points to 2 across all groups. So type size = 2 outside of aes() in geom_point(). Lets apply different color for each class of the cars by writing color = class in aes() from ggplot(). fill = class is needed when the shape of the point is set to 21-25. ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = class)) + geom_point(size = 2) To use other colors, we could use a function from ggplot2 called scale_color_manual(). scale_fill_manual() is used when the shape of the point has borders (shape = 21-25). To find how many colors we need total, we need to find how many groups exist. unique_classes &lt;- unique(mpg$class) In R, you can extract data from one column by using $. You can try it with different variables too. unique() returns unique values in the selected data. Then compute the number of unique values using length() function. number_of_classes &lt;- length(unique_classes) number_of_classes ## [1] 7 sm_palette accepts the number of colors as input. It returns colors that I use most often. Now that we know we need 7 colors total, we can type sm_palette(7) or sm_palette(number_of_classes) for values in scale_color_manual(). ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = class)) + geom_point(size = 2) + scale_color_manual(values = sm_palette(number_of_classes)) + sm_corr_theme() Lets store this graph using a variable called figure1. figure1 &lt;- ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = class)) + geom_point() + scale_color_manual(values = sm_palette(number_of_classes)) + sm_corr_theme() ggplot(data = mpg) # make your graph disappear figure1 # it will appear again by calling this variable Now you will able to call forth the graph just by calling the figure1 variable in the console. Lets save the plot as an image in your folder LearnR by using the variable figure1. To save the figure as an image, we will use a function from the cowplot package. The function is save_plot(). There is one important argument: base_asp. This is the ratio of your image (width/height). I usually set it to 1.4. So lets type base_asp = 1.4 in save_plot(). If base_asp is larger than 1, it gets wider than its height. This is recommended when you have a legend. If there is no legend, then base_asp = 1 is recommended. save_plot(&#39;figure1.png&#39;, figure1, base_asp = 1.4) Exercise: try to save it again with a name figure1b.png by typing: save_plot(&#39;figure1b.png&#39;, figure1) Hows the picture? Why does it look different? Type ?save_plot to see what the default base_asp is. Done! The graph (in png file) should be in your LearnR folder. Exercise: Try to open Microsoft Word or PowerPoint and upload figure1. The figure should look the same as it appears in the slides. Exercise: Remove the legend and save the scatterplot with base_asp = 1. Congratulations! You can now make correlation plots with R. 2.4 Summary You have learned the basics of ggplot. You begin by writing a ggplot() function. If aesthetics (color, shape, etc) are specified outside of aes() function, then there is no group difference. If aesthetics are specified in aes(), different groups of data will have different looks. You have learned to add geom layers such as geom_point(), which shows points, and geom_smooth(), which plots the best-fit function. You have learned to plot geom_point() and geom_smooth() in the same graph. smplot functions can be used to improve ggplot2 visually. For correlation plots, add sm_corr_theme(). You can report statistical results and plot linear regression from correlation by sm_statCorr(). You can also select colors using sm_color(). Save the graph as an image file in your working directory. Working directory has to be set in RStudio (Session -&gt; Set Working Directory -&gt; Choose Directory) Then use save_plot() from cowplot to save the image in your directory (folder LearnR).

Remember from the last tutorial that: Functions from the ggplot2 package include ggplot() and other geom functions such as geom_point(), geom_smooth(), etc. Functions from the smplot package improve the ggplot2 graphs visually. However, they are not required to make a graph using ggplot2. The cowplot package has a function called save_plot, which is very useful for saving a graph as an image. data.csv Lets load data.csv in R from your LearnR folder. Then store the loaded data into a variable called df. We will use a function from the tidyverse package called read_csv(). For more information, type ?read_csv(). df &lt;- read_csv(&#39;data.csv&#39;) ## ## -- Column specification ----------------------------------------------------------- ## cols( ## Subject = col_character(), ## Value = col_double(), ## Day = col_character() ## ) If you get an error such as object 'data.csv' not found, make sure you set your working directory in the LearnR folder. Also make sure you have downloaded your data and saved it in the LearnR folder. You can view the entire data frame by typing View(df). View(df) There are three columns in df. The first column (Subject) is the subject number. S1 means the first subject, and S2 second. The second column (Value) is the data. It contains numbers. The third column (Day) is the day of testing. There are three days of measurement: One, Two and Three. What is the data about? 30 patients were tested across three days to see if there was an improvement in their visual function (Value). The higher value, the better the vision. Day One: first day of the study. This is the baseline value. After this measurement, patients received treatment (ex. drug, surgery, etc). Day Two: second day of the study. This is the one day after receiving the treatment. Day Three: third day of the study. This is two days after receiving the treatment. The data are all fake. read_csv('data.csv') Lets use the variable df to store the output from data.csv. df is shortened from data frame, which refers to a structure of the data that is commonly used for data analysis. In fact, data.csv has the structure of a typical data frame. Each column is a variable. Each row represents an observation In future, I suggest you save data that has a similar structure to that of df. Put your own data in Microsoft Excel and save it as a csv file to load it on R. Exercise: Open data.csv using Microsoft Excel. Change the name of third column into Group. Then, save it as data2.csv. What does this data frame indicate now? It indicates there are 30 individuals for each group. Also, there are 3 groups, so there are 90 individuals total. So, it might be better to change the subject number so each person has a unique label, such as S1 to S90. Best way to plot data A popular way to visualize data is plotting a bar graph. However, a bar graph does not show the distribution of the data well. For this reason, boxplot and violin plots have become more popular in scientific writing. 3.2 Boxplot What is a boxplot? This is the basic structure of the boxplot. The line in the middle is the median of the data. The first quartile is the lower 25% of the data. The third quartile is the 75% percentile of the data. The interquartile range is the distance between the first and third quartiles. The lower whisker is the lowest data point without outliers. The upper whisker is the highest data point without outliers. The point that lies outside the whisker is the outlier. Boxplot vs bar graph Here is the basic structure of the bar graph. The boxplot is more informative than bar graph. The bar graph only shows the mean (average) of the data and the standard error. The bar graph does not represent the distribution very well. The narrow errorbar is quite misleading here. For this reason, lets focus on drawing a boxplot. Boxplot using ggplot2 We want to plot Value (y-axis) from each Day (x-axis). As always in ggplot, lets start by writing ggplot(). Make sure you specify the data to plot by writing data = df in ggplot(). Also, you will need to specify the x- and y-axes in the mapping argument within ggplot(). x = Day and y = Value. ggplot(data = df, mapping = aes(x = Day, y = Value)) However, as we learned in the last lesson, ggplot requires geom objects to plot something. Last time we used geom_point(), which plots points. Now, lets use geom_boxplot() to plot a boxplot. ggplot(data = df, mapping = aes(x = Day, y = Value)) + geom_boxplot() Heres the boxplot! But I think there is a problem here. Day Three precedes Day Two in the x-axis. Exercise: Why do you think Three appeared first? Problem: Alphabetical order The issue with the boxplot is that the x-axis followed an alphabetical order. Th precedes Tw. In short, R does not seem to know that we want the order to be One -&gt; Two -&gt; Three. R decided to follow the alphabetical order is because the column Day is shown as &lt;chr&gt;, which means character. df ## # A tibble: 90 x 3 ## Subject Value Day ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 S1 -0.752 One ## 2 S2 0.220 One ## 3 S3 -1.00 One ## 4 S4 1.91 One ## 5 S5 0.395 One ## 6 S6 -0.985 One ## 7 S7 0.585 One ## 8 S8 0.886 One ## 9 S9 0.691 One ## 10 S10 -0.366 One ## # ... with 80 more rows Note that the Subject column is also considered as &lt;chr&gt; (characters) because it contains texts/alphabets. The Value column is categorized as &lt;dbl&gt;, which means double. Double basically means numbers. In R, character is also referred to as string. They mean the same thing. Here are more examples of characters/strings. a &lt;- &#39;R is very useful!&#39; b &lt;- &#39;Dogs are so cute.&#39; c &lt;- &#39;Clarinet is the best.&#39; In these examples, you have stored the characters/strings in the variables a, b and c. Displaying characters in a non-alphabetical order Factors are important when you want to display characters in non-alphabetical order. Factors are variables that have a limited number of different values. For example, if a dataset has two groups (controls and patients), these can be referred to as factors. However, when you are using read_csv() to load data into RStudio, read_csv() will interpret texts/alphabets as characters, not factors. This is a problem when you need a non-alphabetical order, such as one -&gt; two -&gt; three and Jan -&gt; Feb -&gt; Mar -&gt; Apr. To resolve this problem, you will need to change the characters into factors using factor() function. df$Day &lt;- factor(df$Day, levels = c(&#39;One&#39;,&#39;Two&#39;,&#39;Three&#39;)) Remember that &lt;- means equivalent. Also, $ of a data frame can extract a specific column You can also type df$Value and run it to see what happens. You will get all values of the second column Value. df$Value By using factor(), you are making the Day column of df into factor from character. However, you will need to store the factored version of df$Day by using &lt;-. If not, df$Day will stay as character. levels argument in factor() allows you to specify the order of the factors. For more information about factors, please check Chapter 15 of R for Data Science (https://r4ds.had.co.nz/factors.html). Note: you do not have to understand this part 100%. However, if you do encounter similar issues, I suggest you resolve it with the solution above. Double-check if the Day column is factor Lets open the data frame df again. df ## # A tibble: 90 x 3 ## Subject Value Day ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;fct&gt; ## 1 S1 -0.752 One ## 2 S2 0.220 One ## 3 S3 -1.00 One ## 4 S4 1.91 One ## 5 S5 0.395 One ## 6 S6 -0.985 One ## 7 S7 0.585 One ## 8 S8 0.886 One ## 9 S9 0.691 One ## 10 S10 -0.366 One ## # ... with 80 more rows Now we see &lt;fct&gt; in the Day column. This means that the column is now factor, not character. Back to boxplot using ggplot2 Now lets draw the boxplot again. ggplot(data = df, mapping = aes(x = Day, y = Value)) + geom_boxplot() Since we have converted the Day column of df into factor, the boxplot successfully plots each day in the correct order. A boxplot with individual data Sometimes, it is preferable to plot individual data on top of the boxplot. There are many ways to do this. Here is a simple solution by using geom_jitter(). For more information, type ?geom_jitter. ggplot(data = df, mapping = aes(x = Day, y = Value)) + geom_boxplot() + geom_jitter() I think the points are too spread. So lets set the width of the spread in geom_jitter() to 0.15. Also, lets apply a different color of points for each Day. ggplot(data = df, mapping = aes(x = Day, y = Value, color = Day)) + geom_boxplot() + geom_jitter(width = 0.15) Now we can make the boxplot prettier with sm_minimal(), which removes all grids in the graph. We can also set legends = FALSE to remove the legends. Lets also add a title Visual improvement after treatment using ggtitle(), which is a function from the ggplot2 package. ggplot(data = df, mapping = aes(x = Day, y = Value, color = Day)) + geom_boxplot() + geom_jitter(width = 0.15) + sm_minimal(legends = FALSE) + ggtitle(&#39;Visual improvement after treatment&#39;) Now lets set the colors using sm_palette(). Remember from the last lesson that we set the colors in ggplot by using scale_color_manual() for points without borders. Lets write 3 in sm_palette() because we need 3 colors (for each Day). ggplot(data = df, mapping = aes(x = Day, y = Value, color = Day)) + geom_boxplot() + geom_jitter(width = 0.15) + sm_minimal(legends = FALSE) + ggtitle(&#39;Visual improvement after treatment&#39;) + scale_color_manual(values = sm_palette(3)) If you need horizontal grids, you can simply replace sm_minimal() with sm_hgrid(). There is also sm_vgrid() but I will not try it here because it is not so useful in our context. ggplot(data = df, mapping = aes(x = Day, y = Value, color = Day)) + geom_boxplot() + geom_jitter(width = 0.15) + sm_hgrid(legends = FALSE) + ggtitle(&#39;Visual improvement after treatment&#39;) + scale_color_manual(values = sm_palette(3)) geom_boxplot() vs sm_boxplot() geom_boxplot() does not show individual data. You need to add geom_jitter(). sm_boxplot() shows both a boxplot and individual data. It automatically uses sm_hgrid(). ggplot(data = df, mapping = aes(x = Day, y = Value, color = Day)) + sm_boxplot() + ggtitle(&#39;Visual improvement after treatment&#39;) + scale_color_manual(values = sm_palette(3)) Lets keep the color of the boxplot the same across Day. So we should remove color = Day in aes(). However, since the shape is 16 (circle without borders), this will cause the points across Day to have the same color too. So lets change the shape of the points to 21, which is a circle with borders. So fill decides the filling color now. Lets set fill = Day in aes(). Also, color here only affects the border color. Lets set it to white. Make sure you change scale_color_manual() to scale_fill_manual(). ggplot(data = df, mapping = aes(x = Day, y = Value, fill = Day)) + sm_boxplot(shape = 21, color = &#39;white&#39;) + ggtitle(&#39;Visual improvement after treatment&#39;) + scale_fill_manual(values = sm_palette(3)) Now, pick your favorite boxplot and store it in a variable called my_boxplot using &lt;-. my_boxplot &lt;- ggplot(data = df, mapping = aes(x = Day, y = Value, fill = Day)) + sm_boxplot(shape = 21, color = &#39;white&#39;) + ggtitle(&#39;Visual improvement after treatment&#39;) + scale_fill_manual(values = sm_palette(3)) Save boxplot We can save the boxplot by using save_plot() from the cowplot package. Lets set the aspect ratio (width/height) to 1. So, type base_asp = 1. save_plot(&#39;boxplot.jpg&#39;, my_boxplot, base_asp = 1) This image file should now be in your LearnR folder. 3.3 Violin Plot The boxplot represents the distribution quite well but it can still be misleading. Also, it can be visually overwhelming (i.e., too crowded) to some readers. So, researchers have begun favoring the violin plot more. Structure of the violin plot The part in the middle is the widest because it has most points. This part has the highest point density. The lower and upper ends of the violin plot are thinner because there are less points. Lets draw a violin plot in R. Violin plot with ggplot2 Lets draw the violin plot. Specify the x-axis to Day and the y-axis to Value using data frame df. ggplot(data = df, mapping = aes(x = Day, y = Value)) + geom_violin() Notice that since we have already converted the Day column of df into factor, the violin plots x-axis is in the correct order. Also, notice that we can just replace geom_boxplot() with geom_violin(). Violin plot with individual points Lets add individual points to the violin plot by using geom_jitter(). Set width of the spread to 0.15. ggplot(data = df, mapping = aes(x = Day, y = Value)) + geom_violin() + geom_jitter(width = 0.15) Now lets apply different color to each Day like we did in boxplot by using scale_color_manual(). Lets use sm_palette(3). ggplot(data = df, mapping = aes(x = Day, y = Value, color = Day)) + geom_violin() + geom_jitter(width = 0.15) + scale_color_manual(values = sm_palette(3)) Finally, lets make it pretty and remove the legend by applying sm_hgrid() theme, which only has horizontal grids. Lets also add a title Visual improvement after treatment using ggtitle(). ggplot(data = df, mapping = aes(x = Day, y = Value, color = Day)) + geom_violin() + geom_jitter(width = 0.15) + scale_color_manual(values = sm_palette(3)) + sm_hgrid() + ggtitle(&#39;Visual improvement after treatment&#39;) geom_violin() vs sm_violin() geom_violin() does not show individual data. You need to add geom_jitter(). sm_violin() shows both a boxplot and individual data. It automatically uses sm_hgrid(). It also display lines that represent the mean and +/- standard deviation. In sm_violin(), the default shape ('point_shape') is 16, which is the circle without borders. Lets try using sm_violin(). color here filling color of the jittered points. Also, color affects the color of the lines that show the mean and +/- standard deviation. Lets set color = Day in aes() so that we can apply different colors of the lines and the points for each group. Make sure you have scale_color_manual(). ggplot(data = df, mapping = aes(x = Day, y = Value, color = Day)) + sm_violin() + scale_color_manual(values = sm_palette(3)) + ggtitle(&#39;Visual improvement after treatment&#39;) Save your violin plot Pick your violin plot and store it in a variable called my_violin using &lt;-. my_violin &lt;- ggplot(data = df, mapping = aes(x = Day, y = Value, color = Day)) + sm_violin() + scale_color_manual(values = sm_palette(3)) + ggtitle(&#39;Visual improvement after treatment&#39;) We can save the violin plot by using save_plot() from the cowplot package. Lets set the aspect ratio (width/height) to 1. So, type base_asp = 1. save_plot(&#39;violin.jpg&#39;, my_violin, base_asp = 1) This image file should now be in your LearnR folder. 3.4 Summary You have learned how to convert characters to factors. Factor is important to order words/letters in a non-alphabetical order. You can now make a boxplot and a violin plot with R. They are more informative than a bar graph. You have learned to use geom functions, such geom_boxplot(), geom_violin(), and geom_jitter(). These are functions from the ggplot2 package. You can also plot individual data at the same time with functions from the smplot package. These functions are sm_boxplot() and sm_violin().

It also includes tutorials about sm_bar(), sm_bland_altman() and sm_raincloud(), all of which are not mentioned in the preceding chapters. However, this chapter does not describe sm_effsize(), sm_power() and sm_common_axis(); these functions are described in Chapter 5. If you are not sure about any of the functions, please type ? before the function names, ex. ?sm_bar. 4.1 Installation of the Package The smplot package is NOT available on CRAN yet. So, you will need to download it directly from my github for now. To install it, please type in the R console: install.packages(&#39;devtools&#39;) devtools::install_github(&#39;smin95/smplot&#39;) To use the package, load it: library(smplot) What is smplot? smplot is a package that provides functions that visually improve graphs produced from ggplot2. So it does not work with plots made from base R. It was first developed in May 2021. It is free and open source (https://github.com/smin95/smplot). 4.2 smplots Color Palette and Graph Themes smplots color palette Its color palette can be accessed via two functions: sm_color() and sm_palette(). sm_color() accepts the character string of the color name. sm_palette() accepts the number of colors (up to 16) and returns the hex codes accordingly. Figure 4.1: smplots color palette For example, if you want blue and red, just type the input like this: sm_color(&#39;blue&#39;,&#39;red&#39;) ## [1] &quot;#1262b3&quot; &quot;#cc3d3d&quot; But, do not form a single vector that contains two characters. If so, sm_color() will only return the first color. sm_color(c(&#39;blue&#39;,&#39;red&#39;)) ## Warning in if (color == &quot;blue&quot;) return(&quot;#1262b3&quot;): the condition has length &gt; 1 and ## only the first element will be used ## [1] &quot;#1262b3&quot; If you need 5 colors, you can use sm_palette(). sm_palette(5) ## [1] &quot;#cc1489&quot; &quot;#1262b3&quot; &quot;#5b4080&quot; &quot;#e57717&quot; &quot;#0f993d&quot; smplots graph themes There are several its graph themes. The text positions and the font are all similar. sm_corr_theme() and sm_hvgrid() are equivalent. They have major horizontal and vertical grids. This theme is useful for correlation, so I created a duplicate function sm_corr_theme(). sm_bar_theme() and sm_hgrid() are equivalent. They have major horizontal grids. This theme is useful for a bar graph, so I created a duplicate function sm_bar_theme(). sm_minimal has no major grid. This is useful when a graph has a lot of annotation, such as texts and arrows. sm_slope_theme() is a theme for a slope chart. It removes everything except the y-axis. All of these functions, except for sm_slope_theme(), have two arguments: borders and legends. For some of these functions, the defaults are set to borders = TRUE and legends = TRUE. You can check the defaults by typing ? in front of the function. Ex: ?sm_corr_theme There is no option for borders in sm_slope_theme(). p1 has the default theme of ggplot2. library(tidyverse) p1 &lt;- ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = class)) + geom_point(size = 2) p1 Now we can change the theme using sm_corr_theme(). p1 + sm_corr_theme() We can also remove borders and legends by setting them as FALSE. p2 &lt;- p1 + sm_corr_theme(borders = FALSE, legends = FALSE) p2 You can also apply smplots colors by using scale_color_manual(). p2 + scale_color_manual(values = sm_palette(7)) 4.3 Correlation Plot sm_corr_theme() and sm_statCorr() can be used as a pair when plotting a correlation. This is the plot using the default theme of ggplot2. p1 &lt;- ggplot(data = mtcars, mapping = aes(x = drat, y = mpg)) + geom_point(shape = 21, fill = sm_color(&#39;green&#39;), color = &#39;white&#39;, size = 3) p1 The next plot uses sm_corr_theme() to apply the smplots theme and sm_statCorr() to print linear regression slope and statistical results from a paired correlation test (Pearsons). Important: sm_statCorr() recognizes the data for the y- and x-axes from the mapping = aes() in ggplot() function. There is no mapping argument in sm_statCorr(). p1 + sm_corr_theme() + sm_statCorr(color = sm_color(&#39;green&#39;)) You can also change the line_type to 'solid' in sm_statCorr(), and change the location of the printed texts by using label_x and label_y arguments. You can also change the font size of the printed texts by setting text_size to a larger numerical value. p1 + sm_corr_theme() + sm_statCorr(color = sm_color(&#39;green&#39;), line_type = &#39;solid&#39;, label_x = 3.5, label_y = 30, text_size = 5) 4.3.1 Data frame for a correlation plot Column 1 has to be the data for x-axis. Column 2 has to be the data for y-axis. This structure of the data frame is slightly different from that is typically used in ggplot2 and smplot functions (ex. sm_boxplot(), sm_bar(), sm_violin() and sm_raincloud()). Correlation plot and a bar plot requires a different data frame structure. # Example set.seed(11) # generate random data method1 = c(rnorm(19,0,1),2.5) method2 = c(rnorm(19,0,1),2.5) Subject &lt;- rep(paste0(&#39;S&#39;,seq(1:20)), 2) Data &lt;- data.frame(Value = matrix(c(method1,method2),ncol=1)) Method &lt;- rep(c(&#39;Method 1&#39;, &#39;Method 2&#39;), each = length(method1)) df_general &lt;- cbind(Subject, Data, Method) # used for sm_bar(), sm_boxplot(), sm_violin(), etc df_corr &lt;- data.frame(first = method1, second = method2) # used for correlation We have created two data frames: df_general and df_corr. Lets take a look at their structures. head(df_general) ## Subject Value Method ## 1 S1 -0.59103110 Method 1 ## 2 S2 0.02659437 Method 1 ## 3 S3 -1.51655310 Method 1 ## 4 S4 -1.36265335 Method 1 ## 5 S5 1.17848916 Method 1 ## 6 S6 -0.93415132 Method 1 Notice that df_general has three columns. The first column is subject, second column is data (i.e., Value) and third column is measurement group. head(df_corr) ## first second ## 1 -0.59103110 -0.65571812 ## 2 0.02659437 -0.68251762 ## 3 -1.51655310 -0.01585819 ## 4 -1.36265335 -0.44260479 ## 5 1.17848916 0.35255750 ## 6 -0.93415132 0.07317058 Notice that df_corr has two columns, each of which represents a measurement group. # correlation plot using data frame &#39;df_corr&#39; ggplot(data = df_corr, mapping = aes(x = first, y = second)) + geom_point(shape = 21, fill = sm_color(&#39;cyan&#39;), color = &#39;white&#39;, size = 3) + sm_corr_theme(borders = FALSE) + scale_y_continuous(limits = c(-2.5,2.5)) + scale_x_continuous(limits = c(-2.5,2.5)) + sm_statCorr(color = sm_color(&#39;cyan&#39;), corr_method = &#39;pearson&#39;, label_x = -2.2, label_y = 2.3) + ggtitle(&#39;Correlation plot&#39;) + xlab(&#39;Method 1&#39;) + ylab(&#39;Method 2&#39;) # bar graph using data frame &#39;df_general&#39; ggplot(data = df_general, mapping = aes(x = Method, y = Value, fill = Method)) + sm_bar(shape = 21, color = &#39;white&#39;, bar_fill_color = &#39;gray80&#39;) + scale_fill_manual(values = sm_color(&#39;cyan&#39;,&#39;green&#39;)) 4.3.2 Correlation plot with both regression and reference lines You can also add a reference line (slope = 1) in a correlation plot. This can be done with geom_abline(). In this example, the reference lines slope is set to 1 and it has a dashed line style. # correlation plot using data frame &#39;df_corr&#39; ggplot(data = df_corr, mapping = aes(x = first, y = second)) + geom_point(shape = 21, fill = sm_color(&#39;cyan&#39;), color = &#39;white&#39;, size = 3) + sm_corr_theme(borders = FALSE) + geom_abline(slope = 1, linetype = &#39;dashed&#39;) + scale_y_continuous(limits = c(-2.8,2.8), expand = c(0,0)) + scale_x_continuous(limits = c(-2.8,2.8), expand = c(0,0)) + sm_statCorr(color = sm_color(&#39;cyan&#39;), corr_method = &#39;pearson&#39;, label_x = -2.2, label_y = 2.3) + ggtitle(&#39;Correlation plot&#39;) + xlab(&#39;Method 1&#39;) + ylab(&#39;Method 2&#39;) 4.4 Boxplot - sm_boxplot() sm_boxplot() generates a boxplot and individual points at the same time. It automatically uses sm_hgrid() as its default theme. First, lets generate some random data. set.seed(1) # generate random data day1 = rnorm(16,0,1) day2 = rnorm(16,5,1) Subject &lt;- rep(paste0(&#39;S&#39;,seq(1:16)), 2) Data &lt;- data.frame(Value = matrix(c(day1,day2),ncol=1)) Day &lt;- rep(c(&#39;Day 1&#39;, &#39;Day 2&#39;), each = length(day1)) df &lt;- cbind(Subject, Data, Day) Now, lets make a boxplot using sm_boxplot(). # a boxplot with the random data, all black points ggplot(data = df, mapping = aes(x = Day, y = Value)) + sm_boxplot(fill = &#39;black&#39;) Now lets apply different color for each Day. # a boxplot with different colored points ggplot(data = df, mapping = aes(x = Day, y = Value, fill = Day)) + sm_boxplot(shape = 21, color = &#39;white&#39;) + scale_fill_manual(values = sm_color(&#39;blue&#39;,&#39;orange&#39;)) You can change the shape of the boxplot by setting notch = TRUE. You can also change the size of the individual points using point_size argument. A notched boxplot shows the confidence interval around the median (+/- 1.58 * interquartile range / sqrt(n)). The notches are used for group comparison. If the notch of each box does not overlap, there is a strong likelihood that the medians are significantly different between groups. ggplot(data = df, mapping = aes(x = Day, y = Value, fill = Day)) + sm_boxplot(shape = 21, point_size = 4, notch = &#39;TRUE&#39;, alpha = 0.5) + scale_fill_manual(values = sm_color(&#39;blue&#39;,&#39;orange&#39;)) 4.4.1 Plotting individual points with unique colors One can also use sm_boxplot() to plot individual points with unique colors. But sm_boxplot() cannot print distinct box colors across distinct x levels (i.e., in this example, all boxes are grey). This is because the author thinks it is not a good practice to print different colors of boxes as they tend to distract the reader. ggplot(data = df, mapping = aes(x = Day, y = Value, fill = Subject)) + sm_boxplot(shape = 21, color = &#39;white&#39;) + scale_fill_manual(values = sm_palette(16)) 4.5 Violin Plot - sm_violin() sm_violin() plots a violin plot, individual points and lines that indiciate means and +/- 1 standard deviation at the same time. It is very similar to sm_boxplot() except there is no option for notch = TRUE in sm_violin(). Also sm_violin() uses both color (for the lines of mean and SD) and fill (for the colors of the points) arguments. The default border color of the points is white. sm_violin() automatically uses sm_hgrid() as its default theme. # a violin plot with the random data, all black points and lines ggplot(data = df, mapping = aes(x = Day, y = Value)) + sm_violin(fill = &#39;black&#39;) # a violin plot with different colored points and lines ggplot(data = df, mapping = aes(x = Day, y = Value, color = Day)) + sm_violin() + scale_color_manual(values = sm_color(&#39;blue&#39;,&#39;orange&#39;)) 4.5.1 Plotting individual points with unique colors One can also use sm_violin() to plot individual points with unique colors. The x-level has to be grouped in the aesthetics (ex. group = Day). But sm_violin() cannot print distinct violin colors across distinct x levels (i.e., in this example, all boxes are grey). This is because the author thinks it is not a good practice to print different colors of boxes as they tend to distract the reader. ggplot(data = df, mapping = aes(x = Day, y = Value, fill = Subject, group = Day)) + sm_violin(shape = 21, color = &#39;white&#39;, point_alpha = 0.6) + scale_fill_manual(values = sm_palette(16)) ggplot(data = df, mapping = aes(x = Day, y = Value, fill = Subject, group = Day, color = Day)) + sm_violin(shape = 21, color = &#39;white&#39;, point_alpha = 0.6) + scale_fill_manual(values = sm_palette(16)) + scale_color_manual(values = sm_color(&#39;blue&#39;, &#39;orange&#39;)) 4.6 Bar Plot - sm_bar() It automatically uses sm_bar_theme() / sm_hgrid(). Lets use data (df) we generated before. ggplot(data = df, mapping = aes(x = Day, y = Value, fill = Day)) + sm_bar(shape = 21, color = &#39;white&#39;, bar_fill_color = &#39;gray80&#39;) + scale_fill_manual(values = sm_color(&#39;blue&#39;,&#39;orange&#39;)) In this case, the error bar represents standard error. If you prefer to show standard deviation, then you should set errorbar_type = 'sd' in sm_bar(). ggplot(data = df, mapping = aes(x = Day, y = Value, fill = Day)) + sm_bar(shape = 21, color = &#39;white&#39;, bar_fill_color = &#39;gray80&#39;, errorbar_type = &#39;sd&#39;) + scale_fill_manual(values = sm_color(&#39;blue&#39;,&#39;orange&#39;)) 95% confidence interval also be displayed with errorbar_type = 'ci'. ggplot(data = df, mapping = aes(x = Day, y = Value, fill = Day)) + sm_bar(shape = 21, color = &#39;white&#39;, bar_fill_color = &#39;gray80&#39;, errorbar_type = &#39;ci&#39;) + scale_fill_manual(values = sm_color(&#39;blue&#39;,&#39;orange&#39;)) 4.6.1 Plotting individual points with unique colors One can also use sm_bar() to plot individual points with unique colors. ggplot(data = df, mapping = aes(x = Day, y = Value, color = Subject)) + sm_bar(bar_fill_color = &#39;gray80&#39;) + scale_color_manual(values = sm_palette(16)) sm_bar() can also print distinct box colors across distinct x levels. ggplot(data = df, mapping = aes(x = Day, y = Value, color = Subject, fill = Day)) + sm_bar() + scale_color_manual(values = sm_palette(16)) + scale_fill_manual(values = sm_color(&#39;lightorange&#39;,&#39;skyblue&#39;)) 4.7 Slope Chart - sm_slope() This function plots a slope chart. A slope chart is useful to describe changes between two different timepoints for each measurement (ex. a participant). It automatically uses sm_slope_theme(). Lets use df that we generated before. Important: To make this function work, the mapping within ggplot() has to have a certain structure. x- and y-axes have to be defined. A slope chart groups each observation (ex. Subject) across x-axis. This has to be specified in mapping as group =. The x-axis cannot be continuous. It has to be discrete. So, it should take the form of character or factor (ex. One, Two, Three). If x-axis only has number (i.e., double form, such as 1.02, 1.05, 1.5), then sm_slope() will produce an error. labels argument is required to use sm_slope(). This refers to the labels of the ticks in the x-axis. Ex. labels = c('Day 1', 'Day 2'). ggplot(data = df, mapping = aes(x = Day, y = Value, group = Subject)) + sm_slope(labels = c(&#39;Day 1&#39;, &#39;Day 2&#39;)) Lets set the shape to 21. Lets make the border color to white. Lets apply the same color to each Day. ggplot(data = df, mapping = aes(x = Day, y = Value, group = Subject)) + sm_slope(labels = c(&#39;Day 1&#39;,&#39;Day 2&#39;), shape = 21, color = &#39;white&#39;, fill = sm_color(&#39;blue&#39;)) You could also apply different color for each Day using scale_fill_manual(). ggplot(data = df, mapping = aes(x = Day, y = Value, group = Subject, fill = Day)) + sm_slope(labels = c(&#39;Day 1&#39;,&#39;Day 2&#39;), shape = 21, color = &#39;white&#39;) + scale_fill_manual(values = sm_color(&#39;blue&#39;,&#39;orange&#39;)) You can also change the line color and other aesthetics. For more information, please type ?sm_slope. ggplot(data = df, mapping = aes(x = Day, y = Value, group = Subject, fill = Day)) + sm_slope(labels = c(&#39;Day 1&#39;,&#39;Day 2&#39;), shape = 21, color = &#39;white&#39;, fill = sm_color(&#39;blue&#39;), line_color = &#39;#ADD8E6&#39;, line_size = 0.6) 4.8 A Bland Altman Plot - sm_bland_altman() sm_bland_altman() and sm_statBlandAlt() functions can be used to create a Bland-Altman plot. The plot is used to measure agreement between two different measurements. It is also used to measure test-retest variability of a method. Lets generate random data. set.seed(1) first &lt;- rnorm(20) second &lt;- rnorm(20) df3 &lt;- as_tibble(cbind(first,second)) # requires library(tidyverse) Now lets draw a Bland Altman plot using sm_bland_altman(), which requires two arguments: first dataset, second dataset. They have to be numerical vectors of equal length. This function automatically uses sm_classic() theme. sm_bland_altman(df3$first, df3$second, color = sm_color(&#39;green&#39;)) + scale_y_continuous(limits = c(-4,4)) The upper dashed line represents the upper limit of the difference between two measurements (mean difference + 1.96 * standard deviation of the difference). The upper dashed line represents the upper limit of the difference between two measurements (mean difference - 1.96 * standard deviation of the difference). The middle dashed line represents the mean difference. The shaded region is the 95% confidence interval of the difference between the two measuremnts from one-sample t-test (difference vs 0). If the shaded region includes 0 in the y-axis, then there is no significant difference (p &gt; 0.05) between 0 and the difference. If it does not include 0, then there is a significant difference. This indicates that the two measurement results are considerably different. I usually label them with annotate(), which is a function from ggplot2. This process can be tedious. Also, sm_statBlandAlt() calculates the statistical values that are necessary to draw a Bland-Altman plot, such as the mean difference, upper and lower limits. This function is used to annotate the values in the plot. The arguments for this function are first and second datasets, just like in sm_bland_altman(). res &lt;- sm_statBlandAlt(df3$first,df3$second) # store the results in res variable sm_bland_altman(df3$first, df3$second, color = sm_color(&#39;green&#39;)) + scale_y_continuous(limits = c(-4,4)) + annotate(&#39;text&#39;, label = &#39;Mean&#39;, x = -1, y = res$mean_diff + 0.4) + annotate(&#39;text&#39;, label = signif(res$mean_diff,3), x = -1, y = res$mean_diff - 0.4) + annotate(&#39;text&#39;, label = &#39;Upper limit&#39;, x = 1.2, y = res$upper_limit + 0.4) + annotate(&#39;text&#39;, label = signif(res$upper_limit,3), x = 1.2, y = res$upper_limit - 0.4) + annotate(&#39;text&#39;, label = &#39;Lower limit&#39;, x = 1.2, y = res$lower_limit + 0.4) + annotate(&#39;text&#39;, label = signif(res$lower_limit,3), x = 1.2, y = res$lower_limit-0.4) Lets change the border color of the circles to white. To do so, we will have to change their shape to 21. sm_bland_altman(df3$first, df3$second, shape = 21, fill = sm_color(&#39;green&#39;), color = &#39;white&#39;) + scale_y_continuous(limits = c(-4,4)) + annotate(&#39;text&#39;, label = &#39;Mean&#39;, x = -1, y = res$mean_diff + 0.4) + annotate(&#39;text&#39;, label = signif(res$mean_diff,3), x = -1, y = res$mean_diff - 0.4) + annotate(&#39;text&#39;, label = &#39;Upper limit&#39;, x = 1.2, y = res$upper_limit + 0.4) + annotate(&#39;text&#39;, label = signif(res$upper_limit,3), x = 1.2, y = res$upper_limit - 0.4) + annotate(&#39;text&#39;, label = &#39;Lower limit&#39;, x = 1.2, y = res$lower_limit + 0.4) + annotate(&#39;text&#39;, label = signif(res$lower_limit,3), x = 1.2, y = res$lower_limit-0.4) 4.9 Raincloud plot - sm_raincloud() A raincloud plot is a combination of jittered points, a boxplot and a violin plot. However, this plot can be visually crowded. Some people like to use raincloud plots, some do not. So, the choice to use it is entirely yours. Lets generate some random data. set.seed(2) # generate random data day1 = rnorm(20,0,1) day2 = rnorm(20,5,1) day3 = rnorm(20,6,1.5) day4 = rnorm(20,7,2) Subject &lt;- rep(paste0(&#39;S&#39;,seq(1:20)), 4) Data &lt;- data.frame(Value = matrix(c(day1,day2,day3,day4),ncol=1)) Day &lt;- rep(c(&#39;Day 1&#39;, &#39;Day 2&#39;, &#39;Day 3&#39;, &#39;Day 4&#39;), each = length(day1)) df2 &lt;- cbind(Subject, Data, Day) The x-axis variable column has to have the right level. If not, you should convert the column as factor and establish the levels correctly. Now lets draw a raincloud plot using sm_raincloud(). sm_raincloud(data = df2, x = Day, y = Value) Lets change the x-axis labels. sm_raincloud(data = df2, x = Day, y = Value) + scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0.25,4.75), labels = c(&#39;1&#39;, &#39;2&#39;, &#39;3&#39;, &#39;4&#39;), breaks = c(1,2,3,4)) + xlab(&#39;Day&#39;) The filling colors of the violin plots and boxplots can be modified by using scale_fill_manual(). The border color of the violin plot can be changed by using scale_color_manual(). I will set it transparent to remove the border of the violin plots. The color of the points can be used by either of the 2 functions depending on the shape, which can be set within sm_raincloud(). sm_raincloud(data = df2, x = Day, y = Value, boxplot_alpha = 0.5, color = &#39;white&#39;, shape = 21, sep_level = 2) + scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0.25,4.75), labels = c(&#39;1&#39;, &#39;2&#39;, &#39;3&#39;, &#39;4&#39;), breaks = c(1,2,3,4)) + xlab(&#39;Day&#39;) + scale_color_manual(values = rep(&#39;transparent&#39;,4)) + scale_fill_manual(values = sm_palette(4)) Since this dataset is a repeated measures (same subject across days), we can also include lines that show the trend of each subject by adding group argument in sm_raincloud(). sep_level is an argument to specify the degree of separation among points, boxplots and violin plots. When sep_level = 0, they will all be crowded. When sep_level = 4, they will all be separated from each other. I personally prefer when the boxplot and violin plots are together, but not the points. So I will set it sep_level = 2. sm_raincloud(data = df2, x = Day, y = Value, boxplot_alpha = 0.5, color = &#39;white&#39;, shape = 21, sep_level = 2) + scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0.25,4.75), labels = c(&#39;1&#39;, &#39;2&#39;, &#39;3&#39;, &#39;4&#39;), breaks = c(1,2,3,4)) + xlab(&#39;Day&#39;) + scale_color_manual(values = rep(&#39;transparent&#39;,4)) + scale_fill_manual(values = sm_palette(4)) You can also flip the raincloud plot by setting which_side to left. sm_raincloud(data = df2, x = Day, y = Value, boxplot_alpha = 0.5, color = &#39;white&#39;, shape = 21, sep_level = 2, which_side = &#39;left&#39;) + scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0.25,4.75), labels = c(&#39;1&#39;, &#39;2&#39;, &#39;3&#39;, &#39;4&#39;), breaks = c(1,2,3,4)) + xlab(&#39;Day&#39;) + scale_color_manual(values = rep(&#39;transparent&#39;,4)) + scale_fill_manual(values = sm_palette(4)) So far the distribution plots (violin plots) have been vertical. We can change their configuration by setting vertical = FALSE. sm_raincloud(data = df2, x = Day, y = Value, boxplot_alpha = 0.5, color = &#39;white&#39;, shape = 21, sep_level = 2, which_side = &#39;left&#39;, vertical = FALSE) + scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0.25,4.75), labels = c(&#39;1&#39;, &#39;2&#39;, &#39;3&#39;, &#39;4&#39;), breaks = c(1,2,3,4)) + xlab(&#39;Day&#39;) + scale_color_manual(values = rep(&#39;transparent&#39;,4)) + scale_fill_manual(values = sm_palette(4)) The orientation is not correct, so lets change it by setting which_side = 'right'. sm_raincloud(data = df2, x = Day, y = Value, boxplot_alpha = 0.5, color = &#39;white&#39;, shape = 21, sep_level = 2, which_side = &#39;right&#39;, vertical = FALSE) + scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0.25,4.75), labels = c(&#39;1&#39;, &#39;2&#39;, &#39;3&#39;, &#39;4&#39;), breaks = c(1,2,3,4)) + xlab(&#39;Day&#39;) + scale_color_manual(values = rep(&#39;transparent&#39;,4)) + scale_fill_manual(values = sm_palette(4)) 4.10 Overriding Defaults of smplots Themes You can override all the defaults by adding theme() object to your ggplot2 graph. Here is a bar graph. ggplot(data = df, mapping = aes(x = Day, y = Value, fill = Day)) + sm_bar(shape = 21, color = &#39;white&#39;, bar_fill_color = &#39;gray80&#39;) + scale_fill_manual(values = sm_color(&#39;blue&#39;,&#39;orange&#39;)) Now lets remove the x-axis title Day. ggplot(data = df, mapping = aes(x = Day, y = Value, fill = Day)) + sm_bar(shape = 21, color = &#39;white&#39;, bar_fill_color = &#39;gray80&#39;) + scale_fill_manual(values = sm_color(&#39;blue&#39;,&#39;orange&#39;)) + theme(axis.title.x = element_blank()) Lets customise the graph more by changing the y-axis title and adding a main title. ggplot(data = df, mapping = aes(x = Day, y = Value, fill = Day)) + sm_bar(shape = 21, color = &#39;white&#39;, bar_fill_color = &#39;gray80&#39;) + scale_fill_manual(values = sm_color(&#39;blue&#39;,&#39;orange&#39;)) + theme(axis.title.x = element_blank()) + ylab(&#39;Value&#39;) + ggtitle(&#39;Reading performance in children&#39;) 4.11 Overriding Defaults of smplot Colors sm_color('blue) prints a hex code for the corresponding. Likewise, sm_color('blue','orange') prints out two hex codes. Therefore, instead of using sm_color() function to call forth the colors, you can directly write the hex codes. my_colors &lt;- c(&#39;#ff1493&#39;, &#39;#483d8B&#39;) # pink and lavender ggplot(data = df, mapping = aes(x = Day, y = Value, fill = Day)) + sm_bar(shape = 21, color = &#39;white&#39;, bar_fill_color = &#39;gray80&#39;) + scale_fill_manual(values = my_colors) "],["data-analysis.html", "Chapter 5 Data Analysis 5.1 filter(), select() and summarise() 5.2 Plotting average data with error bars 5.3 Plotting Individual Data 5.4 Basic Statistics", " Chapter 5 Data Analysis First, you need to load data (.csv file). When you are loading your own .csv file for your data analysis, make sure you place the .csv file of your interest in the folder that has been set to the working directory. In this example, we will be using data from this paper: Seung Hyun Min, Alex S. Baldwin and Robert F. Hess. Ocular dominance plasticity: A binocular combination task finds no cumulative effect with repeated patching (2019). Vision Research, 161, 36-42. We will be creating similar figures to those in the paper (ex. Figure 3A and Figure A2) using smplot. For the PDF copy, please visit https://www.smin95.com/pubs/min2019.pdf. library(tidyverse) df &lt;- read_csv(&#39;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/smin95/dataviz/master/min2019.csv&#39;) df$Day &lt;- factor(df$Day) head(df) ## # A tibble: 6 x 4 ## Subject Day Time Cbratio ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;fct&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 S1 1 0 -0.421 ## 2 S2 1 0 2.82 ## 3 S3 1 0 1.69 ## 4 S4 1 0 2.55 ## 5 S5 1 0 -0.217 ## 6 S6 1 0 0.626 There are 4 columns in this data frame: First, Subject refers to each participant. There are 10 participants total. Next, Day refers to the day of testing. The participants were tested on Day 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5. We will only use Day from 1 and 5. Time refers to the number of minutes after an experimental manipulation (ex. monocular deprivation). These are 0, 3, 6, 12, 24 and 48 minutes, but in the data frame, it says 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5; we will change the labels manually. The Cbratio column refers to the actual data that will be plotted here. In the example below, the plots will have different colors based on Day (1 or 5). Therefore, the values in Day column have to be discrete, not continuous. To make them discrete, one needs to convert the Day column from double (continuous variable) to factor (discrete variable). 5.1 filter(), select() and summarise() 5.1.1 filter() for rows To plot data of each subject separately, we need the data frame to show data only from one subject. This can be achieved as using filter(): filter(df, Subject == &#39;S1&#39;) ## # A tibble: 12 x 4 ## Subject Day Time Cbratio ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;fct&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 S1 1 0 -0.421 ## 2 S1 1 1 0.802 ## 3 S1 1 2 1.01 ## 4 S1 1 3 0.634 ## 5 S1 1 4 -0.245 ## 6 S1 1 5 -0.834 ## 7 S1 5 0 2.42 ## 8 S1 5 1 1.76 ## 9 S1 5 2 1.91 ## 10 S1 5 3 0.609 ## 11 S1 5 4 0.811 ## 12 S1 5 5 0.363 The first argument of filter(), select(), summarise() and mutate() is a data frame. The subsequent argument specifies how the data frame should be treated. The new printed result is a new data frame. filter() is used to filter for rows that meet the requirement of your interest. Here is another example. filter(df, Day == 1) ## # A tibble: 60 x 4 ## Subject Day Time Cbratio ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;fct&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 S1 1 0 -0.421 ## 2 S2 1 0 2.82 ## 3 S3 1 0 1.69 ## 4 S4 1 0 2.55 ## 5 S5 1 0 -0.217 ## 6 S6 1 0 0.626 ## 7 S7 1 0 2.62 ## 8 S8 1 0 1.42 ## 9 S9 1 0 1.54 ## 10 S10 1 0 3.05 ## # ... with 50 more rows The above code can be read as: filter for all rows of the data frame df that have 1 in the Day column. Notice that S1 is a character because it has an alphabet. Therefore, it needs to be written as 'S1'. However, 1 of Day is double, which is essentially just a number digit. Therefore, it can be written as 1 with no quotation mark. Lets try another example. day1 &lt;- filter(df, Day == 1) # save the new data frame into a new variable filter(day1, Subject == &#39;S1&#39;) # this new data frame contains Day 1 and Subject 1 data only. ## # A tibble: 6 x 4 ## Subject Day Time Cbratio ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;fct&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 S1 1 0 -0.421 ## 2 S1 1 1 0.802 ## 3 S1 1 2 1.01 ## 4 S1 1 3 0.634 ## 5 S1 1 4 -0.245 ## 6 S1 1 5 -0.834 The above code can be read as: filter for all rows of the data frame df that have 1 in the Day column. Save this new data frame as day1. Then, filter for all rows of the data frame day1 that have S1 in the Subject column. The above can also be written like the one below: filter(df, Day == 1 &amp; Subject == &#39;S1&#39;) ## # A tibble: 6 x 4 ## Subject Day Time Cbratio ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;fct&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 S1 1 0 -0.421 ## 2 S1 1 1 0.802 ## 3 S1 1 2 1.01 ## 4 S1 1 3 0.634 ## 5 S1 1 4 -0.245 ## 6 S1 1 5 -0.834 The above can be read as: filter for all rows of the data frame df that have 1 in the Day column AND have S1 in the Subject column. filter(df, Day == 1 &amp; Subject == &#39;S1&#39;) ## # A tibble: 6 x 4 ## Subject Day Time Cbratio ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;fct&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 S1 1 0 -0.421 ## 2 S1 1 1 0.802 ## 3 S1 1 2 1.01 ## 4 S1 1 3 0.634 ## 5 S1 1 4 -0.245 ## 6 S1 1 5 -0.834 The above can be read as: filter for all rows of the data frame df that have 1 in the Day column OR have S1 in the Subject column. 5.1.2 select() for columns If you wish to see the Cbratio column only (i.e., data only) for rows of df that have Day == 1 and Time == 0, you can write it like this: day1_time0 &lt;- filter(df, Day == 1 &amp; Time == 0) # save the new data frame in the day1_time0 variable select(day1_time0, Cbratio) ## # A tibble: 10 x 1 ## Cbratio ## &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 -0.421 ## 2 2.82 ## 3 1.69 ## 4 2.55 ## 5 -0.217 ## 6 0.626 ## 7 2.62 ## 8 1.42 ## 9 1.54 ## 10 3.05 There are 10 rows (i.e., 10 subjects) in this filtered data frame and 1 column, which is Cbratio. The above can be read as: filter for all rows of the data frame df that have 1 in the Day column AND have 0 in the Time column. Then, store the new data frame in day1_time0. Then, select for Cbratio column from day1_time0. select() is used to filter for columns that meet the requirement of your interest. 5.1.3 summarise() for grouped summaries df contains individual data for all subjects on Days 1 and 5 across all time points. However, it does not contain average data either for each Day or Time. summarise() can help us enable us to collapse multiple rows of observations into values such as the mean. summarise(df, average = mean(Cbratio)) ## # A tibble: 1 x 1 ## average ## &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 1.35 However, in this case, we got an example of Cbratio across Subject, Day and Time. This average value itself is not so meaningful. If we wish to obtain the average for each Day and Time, we can use the function group_by() to group data for each day and time. As it was the case before, the first argument of group_by() is a data frame. The second argument of group_by() is the name of the column through which you would like to group the data. by_day_time &lt;- group_by(df, Day, Time) print(by_day_time) ## # A tibble: 120 x 4 ## # Groups: Day, Time [12] ## Subject Day Time Cbratio ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;fct&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 S1 1 0 -0.421 ## 2 S2 1 0 2.82 ## 3 S3 1 0 1.69 ## 4 S4 1 0 2.55 ## 5 S5 1 0 -0.217 ## 6 S6 1 0 0.626 ## 7 S7 1 0 2.62 ## 8 S8 1 0 1.42 ## 9 S9 1 0 1.54 ## 10 S10 1 0 3.05 ## # ... with 110 more rows The output of group_by() is a new data frame (it might appear exactly the same as before, ex. df). However, it will respond differently to summarise() because the rows of the data frame are now grouped based on day and time, as we have specified. summarise(by_day_time, Average_Cbratio = mean(Cbratio)) ## # A tibble: 12 x 3 ## # Groups: Day [2] ## Day Time Average_Cbratio ## &lt;fct&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 1 0 1.57 ## 2 1 1 2.21 ## 3 1 2 2.32 ## 4 1 3 0.979 ## 5 1 4 1.25 ## 6 1 5 1.14 ## 7 5 0 1.85 ## 8 5 1 1.49 ## 9 5 2 1.02 ## 10 5 3 1.15 ## 11 5 4 0.759 ## 12 5 5 0.452 This new data frame yields average for each Day and Time. We have now created a new column Average_Cbratio which stores all the average data of Cbratio. Therefore, group_by() and summarise() are very useful together. They provide grouped summaries, such as the average. However, summarise() alone may not be so useful. Besides the average, one might also be interested in obtaining either standard deviation or standard error. However, our df does not contain any data about the standard deviation or standard error per Day or Time, etc. Standard error can be computed with sm_stdErr(). We could obtain standard error with the help of the summarise() function for each Day and Time. summarise(df, standard_error = sm_stdErr(Cbratio)) ## # A tibble: 1 x 1 ## standard_error ## &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 0.115 As we have seen before, we see that standard_error has been calculated across all subjects, day and time. This is not so useful. We should use summarise() with group_by() so that each standard error could be for each Day and Time. by_day_time &lt;- group_by(df, Day, Time) summarise(by_day_time, standard_error = sm_stdErr(Cbratio)) ## # A tibble: 12 x 3 ## # Groups: Day [2] ## Day Time standard_error ## &lt;fct&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 1 0 0.393 ## 2 1 1 0.363 ## 3 1 2 0.400 ## 4 1 3 0.352 ## 5 1 4 0.266 ## 6 1 5 0.438 ## 7 5 0 0.563 ## 8 5 1 0.422 ## 9 5 2 0.462 ## 10 5 3 0.224 ## 11 5 4 0.292 ## 12 5 5 0.193 This standard error is for each Day and Time across all subjects. Now lets obtain the mean and standard error of Cbratio for each Day and Time across all subjects using the data frame that has been grouped by Day and Time via group_by(). by_day_time1 &lt;- summarise(by_day_time, Average = mean(Cbratio), StdError = sm_stdErr(Cbratio)) print(by_day_time1) ## # A tibble: 12 x 4 ## # Groups: Day [2] ## Day Time Average StdError ## &lt;fct&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 1 0 1.57 0.393 ## 2 1 1 2.21 0.363 ## 3 1 2 2.32 0.400 ## 4 1 3 0.979 0.352 ## 5 1 4 1.25 0.266 ## 6 1 5 1.14 0.438 ## 7 5 0 1.85 0.563 ## 8 5 1 1.49 0.422 ## 9 5 2 1.02 0.462 ## 10 5 3 1.15 0.224 ## 11 5 4 0.759 0.292 ## 12 5 5 0.452 0.193 Now you see that the original df, which contains data for each subject, has now been transformed to a new data frame that contains grouped summaries, such as group averages and standard errors. If you are interested in learning more about this topic (data transformation), please check out Chapter 5 of R for Data Science by Hadley Wickham (https://r4ds.had.co.nz/transform.html). 5.2 Plotting average data with error bars We will plot a similar graph to Figure 3A in the Vision Research paper (Min et al., 2019) in this section. Usually, a data frame that has grouped summary information, such as average and standard error across subject, is required to plot a graph that depicts average values. geom_errorbar() is required to plot the error bar. Legend title has been removed with the theme() function. Greek letter Delta is printed with \\u0394. X-tick labels are originally 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 (as specified in the df data frame). However, they can be manually changed using labels = argument in the scale_x_continuous() function. Legend label can also be changed in labels = from the scale_color_manual() function because each Day has been defined by each color; this is the case because color = Day in aes(..., ..., color = Day). ggplot(data = by_day_time1, aes(x = Time, y = Average, color = Day)) + geom_point(size = 4.5) + geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = Average - StdError, ymax = Average + StdError), size = .5, width = .05) + geom_smooth(method = &#39;lm&#39;, se = F, size = 0.9) + # lm = linear regression method scale_x_continuous(breaks = unique(df$Time), labels = c(&quot;0&quot;, &quot;3&quot;, &quot;6&quot;, &quot;12&quot;, &quot;24&quot;, &quot;48&quot;)) + sm_hgrid(legends = TRUE) + scale_color_manual(values = sm_color(&#39;blue&#39;,&#39;orange&#39;), labels = c(&quot;Day 1&quot;, &quot;Day 5&quot;)) + ggtitle(&quot;Recovery of the patching effect&quot;) + xlab(&quot;Time after monocular deprivation (min)&quot;) + ylab(&quot;\\u0394 Contrast balance ratio (dB)&quot;) + theme(legend.justification = c(1,0), legend.position = c(0.96, 0.67), legend.title = element_blank()) 5.3 Plotting Individual Data In this section, we will plot a similar graph to Figure A2 in the Vision Research paper (Min et al., 2019). First, you will need several packages for this section. If you do not have the gridExtra and grid packages in your RStudio, please install them using the codes below. It might take less than a minute. install.packages(&#39;gridExtra&#39;) install.packages(&#39;grid&#39;) Then load all these packages below. library(tidyverse) library(cowplot) library(smplot) library(gridExtra) library(grid) Now lets plot data for each subject (S1-S9) except S10. Each panel shows the data of each subject for both Days 1 and 5. df_s1 &lt;- filter(df, Subject == &#39;S1&#39;) # rows of df that only contain S1 in the Subject column # use df_s1 to plot the data of S1 plot_s1 &lt;- ggplot(data = df_s1, aes(x = Time, y = Cbratio, color = Day)) + geom_point(size = 4.5) + geom_smooth(method = &#39;lm&#39;, se = F, size = 0.9) + #

Here is the illustration of what we are going to do. Figure 5.1: 3x3 figure. It has 3 columns and 3 rows When you are saving the graph as an image file, nrow and ncol in save_plot() have to match the values in plot_grid() as shown below. plot_grid() is a function that puts different graphs together (ex. 3x3 structure). save_plot() is a function that saves a selected graph into an image or PDF file (or eps, etc). together1 &lt;- plot_grid(plot_s1, plot_s2, plot_s3, plot_s4, plot_s5, plot_s6, plot_s7, plot_s8, plot_s9, ncol = 3, # 3 columns in the final figure nrow = 3, # 3 rows in the final figure align = &#39;hv&#39;,# set to the same horizontal and vertical # lengths of each panel. labels = c(&#39;S1&#39;,&#39;S2&#39;, &#39;S3&#39;, &#39;S4&#39;,&#39;S5&#39;,&#39;S6&#39;, &#39;S7&#39;,&#39;S8&#39;,&#39;S9&#39;), # each panel label label_x = 0.14,# horizontal position of the panel&#39;s # label relative to each panel. 0 is the very # left of the plot. label_y = 0.97) # vertical position of the panel&#39;s # label relative to each panel. 1 is the very # top of the plot. print(together1) save_plot(&#39;together1.png&#39;,together1,nrow=3,ncol=3,base_asp=0.95) # save as an image. ncol and nrow in save_plot() # nrow and ncol in save_plot() have to match the values in plot_grid() as shown above. Open together1.png in your directory folder. Notice that the png file may look different from the one printed in your RStudio screen or on the browser as shown in this guide. As long as your png file looks good, it should be okay. Note that are some repeating x and y-axes labels. We can remove them. For instance, the top left panels x-axis labels can be removed because the bottom left panel also has the x-axis labels. Another instance is that the y-axis labels of the top right panel can be removed because the top left panel has the same label. Also, it seems that there are some empty space between amongst panel. Lets remove them by reducing the margin of each panel. For more information about the function plot_grid, please type ?plot_grid in the console. We will use the function sm_common_axis() to resolve these issues. sm_common_axis() has an argument called location. This refers to the location of each panel in the combined figure that you will make. The picture here illustrates what you will need to write for location in the function sm_common_axis(). Example: sm_common_axis(location = 'topleft') for the very top left panel of the 3x3 combined figure. Figure 5.2: Arguments for location in sm_common_axis for 3x3 figure. plot_s1_b &lt;- plot_s1 + sm_common_axis(location = &#39;topleft&#39;) plot_s2_b &lt;- plot_s2 + sm_common_axis(location = &#39;topcenter&#39;) plot_s3_b &lt;- plot_s1 + sm_common_axis(location = &#39;topright&#39;) plot_s4_b &lt;- plot_s4 + sm_common_axis(location = &#39;topleft&#39;) plot_s5_b &lt;- plot_s5 + sm_common_axis(location = &#39;topcenter&#39;) plot_s6_b &lt;- plot_s6 + sm_common_axis(location = &#39;topright&#39;) plot_s7_b &lt;- plot_s7 + sm_common_axis(location = &#39;bottomleft&#39;) plot_s8_b &lt;- plot_s1 + sm_common_axis(location = &#39;bottomcenter&#39;) plot_s9_b &lt;- plot_s9 + sm_common_axis(location = &#39;bottomright&#39;) together2 &lt;- plot_grid(plot_s1_b, plot_s2_b, plot_s3_b, plot_s4_b, plot_s5_b, plot_s6_b, plot_s7_b, plot_s8_b, plot_s9_b, ncol = 3, # 3 columns in the final figure nrow = 3, # 3 rows in the final figure align = &#39;hv&#39;,# set to the same horizontal and vertical # lengths of each panel. labels = c(&#39;S1&#39;,&#39;S2&#39;, &#39;S3&#39;, &#39;S4&#39;,&#39;S5&#39;,&#39;S6&#39;, &#39;S7&#39;,&#39;S8&#39;,&#39;S9&#39;), # each panel label label_x = 0.07) # horizontal position of the panel&#39;s # label relative to each panel. # 0 is the very left of the plot. print(together2) save_plot(&#39;together2.png&#39;,together2,nrow=3,ncol=3,base_asp=0.95) # save as an image. ncol and nrow in save_plot() # nrow and ncol in save_plot() have to match the # values in plot_grid() as shown above. Open together2.png in your directory folder. I think it looks a lot cleaner! If you are planning to make a 1x3 figure (1 row, 3 columns), here is the illustration. Figure 5.3: Arguments for location in sm_common_axis for 1x3 figure. If you are planning to make a 2x2 figure (2 rows, 2 columns), here is the illustration. Figure 5.4: Arguments for location in sm_common_axis for 2x2 figure. We are almost done now. You need to add the y-axis label ('Contrast balance ratio'), x-axis label ('Minutes after monocular deprivation') and the title ('Recovery of the patching effect') as shown in the original paper (Vision Research 2019). You can do this in Adobe Illustrator or directly in R. Here, I present a solution with R. You dont have to understand the codes below to use the codes. title &lt;- ggdraw() + draw_label(&#39;Recovery of the patching effect&#39;, size = 17, hjust = 0.45, vjust = 1.2) # title of the 3x3 figure. # vjust controls the vertical position of the title. # hjust controls the horizontal position of the title. plot_with_title &lt;- plot_grid(title, together2, ncol = 1, rel_heights = c(0.1 ,1)) # add the title and the 3x3 figure together combined_plot &lt;- add_sub(plot_with_title, &quot;Minutes after monocular deprivation&quot;, y = 0, vjust = -.3, size = 17) # add x-axis title to the 3x3 figure # add y-axis title to the 3x3 figure combined_plot &lt;- grid.arrange(combined_plot, left = textGrob(&quot;\\u0394 Contrast Balance Ratio (dB)&quot;, gp = gpar(fontsize = 17), rot = 90)) save_plot(&quot;combined_plot.png&quot;, combined_plot, ncol = 3, nrow = 3, base_aspect_ratio = .9, limitsize = F) Open combined_plot.png file in your directory folder. Does it look similar to the one in the web browser? On my computer, they look very different, and I much prefer the png file. Here is the actual png file: Figure 5.5: Combined plot To be honest, for adding the titles of the axes and the graph, using Adobe Illustrator might be much easier. I just included the codes here to demonstrate that everything, however, can be done in R. If you do not understand some of these functions, you can type in your console ?add_sub, ?grid.arrange to learn about these functions. An astute reader will realize that the codes are quite repetitive. Could the codes be shortened? The answer is yes! However, this method is quite complex and beyond the scope of this book. 5.4 Basic Statistics We will use the df dataset for this example to demonstrate t-test, effect size and power analysis. head(df) ## # A tibble: 6 x 4 ## Subject Day Time Cbratio ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;fct&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 S1 1 0 -0.421 ## 2 S2 1 0 2.82 ## 3 S3 1 0 1.69 ## 4 S4 1 0 2.55 ## 5 S5 1 0 -0.217 ## 6 S6 1 0 0.626 5.4.1 T-test In this example, we will compare changes in sensory eye dominance after short-term monocular deprivation in Day 1 vs Day 5. These values are shown in the Cbratio column. Lets filter only for data that are Time == 0 for Day 1 and Day 5, which refers to 0 minutes after short-term monocular deprivation for 120 minutes. # 0 minutes after short-term monocular deprivation df_0min &lt;- filter(df, Time == 0) Now, lets plot a bar graph to display contrast balance ratio (Cbratio) from Days 1 and 5 at 0 minutes after short-term monocular deprivation using sm_bar(). ggplot(data = df_0min, mapping = aes(x = Day, y = Cbratio, fill = Day)) + sm_bar(shape = 21, color = &#39;white&#39;, bar_fill_color = &#39;gray80&#39;) + scale_fill_manual(values = sm_color(&#39;blue&#39;,&#39;orange&#39;)) + ggtitle(&#39;Cbratio at 0min&#39;) There seems to be a very small difference in the contrast balance ratio (Cbratio) between Days 1 and 5. The error bars (in this case, standard error) are overlapping; this indicates that there is no significant difference (p &lt; 0.05) between the two datasets. Lets take a look if my prediction is correct by using a t-test using the function t.test. df_0min ## # A tibble: 20 x 4 ## Subject Day Time Cbratio ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;fct&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 S1 1 0 -0.421 ## 2 S2 1 0 2.82 ## 3 S3 1 0 1.69 ## 4 S4 1 0 2.55 ## 5 S5 1 0 -0.217 ## 6 S6 1 0 0.626 ## 7 S7 1 0 2.62 ## 8 S8 1 0 1.42 ## 9 S9 1 0 1.54 ## 10 S10 1 0 3.05 ## 11 S1 5 0 2.42 ## 12 S2 5 0 0.721 ## 13 S3 5 0 1.76 ## 14 S4 5 0 -1.14 ## 15 S5 5 0 2.56 ## 16 S6 5 0 4.79 ## 17 S7 5 0 2.93 ## 18 S8 5 0 3.30 ## 19 S9 5 0 -0.502 ## 20 S10 5 0 1.68 t.test allows us to compare whether data between two different groups are significantly different. Since we will only compare values in the Cbratio column, lets select for the Cbratio column and use these values in our t.test. df_0min_day1 &lt;- select(filter(df_0min, Day == 1), Cbratio) print(df_0min_day1) ## # A tibble: 10 x 1 ## Cbratio ## &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 -0.421 ## 2 2.82 ## 3 1.69 ## 4 2.55 ## 5 -0.217 ## 6 0.626 ## 7 2.62 ## 8 1.42 ## 9 1.54 ## 10 3.05 print(df_0min_day1$Cbratio) ## [1] -0.4206 2.8213 1.6856 2.5496 -0.2166 0.6264 2.6196 1.4151 1.5372 ## [10] 3.0519 df_0min_day5 &lt;- select(filter(df_0min, Day == 5), Cbratio) print(df_0min_day5) ## # A tibble: 10 x 1 ## Cbratio ## &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 2.42 ## 2 0.721 ## 3 1.76 ## 4 -1.14 ## 5 2.56 ## 6 4.79 ## 7 2.93 ## 8 3.30 ## 9 -0.502 ## 10 1.68 Notice that when df_0min_day1 has a column entitled Cbratio with 10 rows of data. However, df_0min_day1$Cbratio prints ONLY the values within the Cbratio column. This is because $ is used to extract a specific column within a data frame. You could type df_0min$ , press the Tab button from the keyboard, and see what happens. t.test(df_0min_day1$Cbratio, df_0min_day5$Cbratio, paired = TRUE) ## ## Paired t-test ## ## data: df_0min_day1$Cbratio and df_0min_day5$Cbratio ## t = -0.34797, df = 9, p-value = 0.7359 ## alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## -2.132114 1.563634 ## sample estimates: ## mean of the differences ## -0.28424 In this case, the subjects are paired because the 10 subjects performed on both Days 1 and 5. If your data are not paired (ex. patients vs controls) and you want to perform a t-test, you can set paired = FALSE. If we are reporting the results, we should report it as such, t(9) = -0.35, p = 0.736. The difference between Days 1 and 5 is not significant. 5.4.2 Effect Size However, even if p-value is larger than 0.05, this does not mean that there is no significant difference between the two groups. In fact, even a strong drug effect in a study that compares placebo vs. drug can result in p &gt; 0.05 if the sample size is too small. On the other hand, if a study is conducted a very large sample size (1000 patients per group) to examine the effect of a very weak drug, the data between weak drug and control can give us a p &lt; 0.05, which indicates a statistically significant difference. In short, p-value is not everything because it depends on the sample size. If the sample size is small, p-value can be larger than 0.05. But as the sample gets larger, p-value will decrease even if the mean difference between the two groups remains the same. In this example, the sample size is not large (n=10). Therefore, one might ask whether our conclusion that there is no significant difference between Days 1 and 5 is truly valid. One might also believe that if our sample size was larger (ex. n=50), we would have found a significant difference between Days 1 and 5. To respond to this concern, we might need to calculate the effect size. If the effect size is large, there is a large difference between the sample groups. Unlike the p-value, the effect size does not depend on the sample size. One measure to capture the effect size is Cohens d. We can use sm_effsize() to calculate Cohens d as a measure for the effect size. Small effect size: Cohens d around 0.2 Medium effect size: Cohens d around 0.5 Large effect size: Cohens d &gt; 0.8. The inputs for sm_effsize() are the data of two sample groups, just as they were in t.test(). sm_effsize(df_0min_day1$Cbratio, df_0min_day5$Cbratio) ## [1] 0.185056 Cohens d equals 0.185, which is a very small effect size. This indicates that there is a very small difference in data between Days 1 and 5. Also, it is recommended that both p-value and effect size are reported in scientific papers. In this example, I would report the results as: t(9) = -0.35, p = 0.74, Cohens d = 0.19. 5.4.3 Power Analysis We got p &gt; 0.05 with our small sample size (n = 10). As we previously mentioned, we know that p-value gets smaller with an increasing sample size. Therefore, given the mean difference between two sample groups (i.e., same effect size), the p-value can change depending on the sample size. So, it is important to report both the p-value and the effect size. So, one might be concerned with what would be the minimal sample size to detect a statistically significant difference between the two groups (Days 1 and 5). This can be achieved using power analysis. Note that p can always be less than 0.05 as long as the sample size meets the requirement (i.e., very large). If the effect size was large but the data yielded p &gt; 0.05, then we could predict that the minimal sample size from power analysis would be not large. If the effect size was small and the data yielded p &gt; 0.05, as it was for my data, the minimal sample size to yield p &lt; 0.05 would need to be very large. If the minimal sample size from power analysis was not large (hence, large effect size), then one could conclude that I did not collect enough data and incorrectly concluded that there was no significant difference between the two groups. This would be so because if the sample size was larger, I would have gotten p &lt; 0.05. Power analysis can be performed using sm_power(). The inputs for sm_power() are data of two sample groups, just as they were in t.test(). sm_power(df_0min_day1$Cbratio, df_0min_day5$Cbratio, paired = TRUE) ## ## Paired t test power calculation ## ## n = 231.1206 ## d = 0.185056 ## sig.level = 0.05 ## power = 0.8 ## alternative = two.sided ## ## NOTE: n is number of *pairs* According to our power analysis (significant level = 0.05, power = 80%), we would need 232 subjects per group (n = 231.1206) for the p-value to reach below 0.05 and, therefore, for us to detect a statistically significant difference in contrast balance ratio between Days 1 and 5. In other words, the difference between Days 1 and 5 is very small. Also, the conclusion that there was no difference between the days seems to be valid even though the sample size is small.
