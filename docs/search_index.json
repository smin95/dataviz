Figure 0.1: Standalone plots created with smplot2. Visit chapters 3-6 for more information. Figure 0.2: A composite plot generated with smplot2. For more details about creating and annotating a composite figure using programmatic constructs and smplot2, please check out Chapter 7. This guide (https://smin95.github.io/dataviz) aims to familiarize the reader with R, a programming language, for data visualization. It also introduces the R package smplot2, which aims to make the process of data visualization simple. This guide was created entirely using bookdown for reproducibility.
