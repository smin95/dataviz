## Upload sample data 

### Sample data: mpg {-}

- I will be using an example from the book *R for Data Science* (https://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html).
- **Question: Do cars with large engines use up more fuel than the those with small ones?**
- Let's open **mpg**, which is a **data frame** stored in the **ggplot2** package.
- **mpg** contains data about cars in the US. You can type `?mpg` for more information.
  - **displ**: the size of the car's engine in liters
  - **hwy**: fuel efficiency. If it's high, then the car uses less fuel per distance.
  
```{r}
mpg
```

- Notice that some columns and rows are not shown. You can type `View(mpg)` to see the entire **data frame**.
- Each row is an unique observation.
- Each column is an unique variable/condition. 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
View(mpg)
```

## Basics of ggplot2

### Let's make some graphs {-}

- Question: Do cars with large engines use up more fuel than the those with small ones?
- To answer our question, we need to plot **mpg** data. The x-axis should be **displ**, the y-axis should be **hwy**. 

```{r, fig.width = 3.7, fig.height=3.7}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
```

- We find that a smaller car has a higher efficiency and that a larger car has a lower efficiency. In other words, we see a negative relationship. 

### How ggplot works {-}

- When you are making a graph with **ggplot2**, always begin by typing the function `ggplot()`. 
  - The **data** you want to plot is the **first argument** here. Ex. `ggplot(data = mpg)`. 
- However, `ggplot(data = mpg)` alone does not create a graph. You will need **add** (by typing **+**) more layers, such as `geom_point()`.
  - `geom_point()` adds points to your graphs. You will need to specify (or map) x- and y-axes in the `aes()` function, which means aesthetics. This process is called **mapping**.
  - As you might expect, there are other **geom** functions, such as `geom_bar()`, `geom_boxplot()`, `geom_errorbar()`. They plot bar graphs, boxplots and error bars, respectively. 
- Here is the **template** for using **ggplot2** (copied from *R for Data Science*).

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(data = <DATA>) + 
  <GEOM_FUNCTION>(mapping = aes(<MAPPINGS>))
```
  
  
### Different color of points for each unique group {-}

- You can apply different colors by the **class** of each car (each car = each row of the **mpg** data frame).
  - Include `class` variable in the `aes()` function.
  - This maps the third variable `class` into your graph.
  - `aes()` means aesthetic (ex. color, shape, etc).

```{r, fig.width = 5.3, fig.height=3.7}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = class))
```

- You can also set different shapes for each group of the data.

```{r, fig.width =5.3, fig.height = 3.7, warning = F}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, shape = class))
```

- Or size or transparency (not recommended). But you get the idea. Using `aes()` in a geom function (ex. `geom_point()`), you can label different group of points.

```{r, fig.width =5.3, fig.height = 3.7, warning = F}
# different levels of transparency (alpha) for each group
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, alpha = class))
```

```{r, fig.width =5.3, fig.height = 3.7, warning = F}
# different sizes of the points for each group
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, size = class))
```

### Different color & shape for each group {-}

- You can also apply different color & shape for each group of the data.
  - **Exercise**: Try it on your own before you look at the code below.
  
```{r, fig.width = 5.3, fig.height=3.7, warning = F}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = class,
                           shape = class))
```

### Same shape across all groups {-}

- So far, you have put variables such as `shape` and `color` inside the function `aes()`.
  - This has enabled you to apply different shape and color for each group.
- If you put the variable for `shape`, `color`, `size` outside of `aes()` in the geom function, then all data points will have the specified `shape`, `color`, etc even if they are in different groups.

```{r, fig.width = 5.3, fig.height=3.7, warning = F}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy,
                           color = class), shape = 17)
```

- Notice that the `color` is different for each group because it is inside the function `aes()`. However, all the points are triangle because we have typed `shape = 17` outside the function `aes()`.
- **Exercise:** try changing the shape of the points to the circle with the border.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align = 'center', fig.cap="image from http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/ggplot2-point-shapes", out.width = '25%'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/shape.jpg")
```

### Exercise: try changing the shape of the points to the circle with the border. {-}

- When `shape = 19`, the shape is the circle without the border.
- When `shape = 20`, the shape is the small circle without the border.
- When `shape = 21`, the shape is the circle with the border.
- So let's set `shape` to 21.

```{r, fig.width = 5.3, fig.height=3.7}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = class), shape = 21)
```

- Notice that the border color is different for each group, but not the color that fills the circle.
- Shapes without their borders (15-20) are filled with `color`.
- Shapes with the border (21-24) are filled with `fill` and its border colored with `color`.
- So let's change `color = Class` to `fill = Class`. 

```{r, fig.width = 5.3, fig.height=3.7}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, fill = class), shape = 21)
```


### How do we draw the best-fit line of the graph? {-}

- Here is our graph. 

```{r, fig.width = 3.7, fig.height=3.7}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
```

- There seems to be a negative relationship. 
- How do we draw the best-fit line of the graph's negative relationship?
- Use another geom function `geom_smooth()`.

```{r, fig.width = 3.7, fig.height=3.7}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
```

### geom_point() + geom_smooth() {-}

```{r, fig.width = 3.7, fig.height=3.7}
```

- Now let's combine geom_point() + geom_smooth() into one graph.

```{r, fig.width = 3.7, fig.height=3.7}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
```

- `ggplot()` acts as a system where you can add multiple `geom` objects, such as `geom_point()` and `geom_smooth()`.
- You can add multiple layers of geom in a single plot, like shown here.
- `ggplot()` and **at least one geom** function are necessary to draw a graph.
- `ggplot()` alone does not draw a graph. Try it on your own.

```{r, fig.width = 3.7, fig.height=3.7}
ggplot(data = mpg)
```

### Writing shorter codes {-}

```{r, eval = FALSE, fig.width = 3.7, fig.height=3.7}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
```

- Notice that we have typed `mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)` twice.  This is **repetitive**.
- If you type the `mapping` argument in `ggplot()`, you won't need to type them anymore in the subsequent `geom` functions.

```{r, fig.width = 3.7, fig.height=3.7, warning = F}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth()
```

- This is exactly the same as the previous graph. In both cases, the mapping has been set so that the x-axis is `displ` and the y-axis is `hwy` in both `geom_point()` and `geom_smooth()`.

- Now let's apply different color of points and the fit the line for each group.

```{r, fig.width = 5.3, fig.height=3.7, warning = F}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = class)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth()
```

- Okay, this is extremely messy and probably a bad idea. 
  - You might have gotten `warnings` but you can usually ignore them.
- Let's plot the best-fit line across all groups (i.e., one best-fit line) but apply different color for each class (i.e., many colors).
- To do so, type `color = class` in geom_point, not `ggplot()`. This enables you to specify that you will apply different color for each class **only** in `geom_point()` but not in `geom_smooth()`.

```{r, fig.width = 5.3, fig.height=3.7, warning = F}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point(aes(color = class)) +
  geom_smooth()
```

## Improve dataviz using smplot

- Although the default theme of ggplot2 graphs is clean, there are some things that I do not like:
  - The fonts are too small.
  - The grey background is distracting.
  - There are too many grids.

```{r, fig.width = 5.2, fig.height=3.7, warning = F}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = class)) + 
  geom_point() 
```

- Let's make this graph prettier by using functions from **smplot**.
  - In this example, let's use `sm_corr_theme()`. I've made this function as a theme suitable for correlation plots.
  - Disclaimer: **smplot** package has been built based on my preference.
  - **smplot** is not necessary to make a **ggplot** graph or change its style. It is possible to change every aspect of the graph with **ggplot2** but this requires about 8-20 lines of codes (based on my experience). Instead, **smplot** function does so in one line of code.

```{r, fig.width = 5.2, fig.height=3.7, warning = F}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = class)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  sm_corr_theme()
```

- Now let's remove the border within `sm_corr_theme()` by setting `borders = FALSE`.

```{r, fig.width = 5.2, fig.height=3.7, warning = F}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = class)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  sm_corr_theme(borders = FALSE)
```

- **Exercise:** You can also set `borders = TRUE` and see what happens. 

```{r, eval = F}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = class)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  sm_corr_theme(borders = TRUE)
```

- You might notice that borders come back. This is exactly what happens when you do not include `borders` argument in `sm_corr_theme()`. This is because `sm_corr_theme()` is set to `borders = TRUE` as default. 

- I think the one with the border looks better. 
- You can also remove the legend by setting `legends = FALSE` in `sm_corr_theme()`. 

```{r, fig.width = 3.7, fig.height=3.7, warning = F}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = class)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  sm_corr_theme(legends = FALSE)
```

- **Exercise** Set `legends = TRUE` and see what happens. Type `?sm_corr_theme` to see why legends appear without directly writing `legends = TRUE`. 

```{r, eval = F}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = class)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  sm_corr_theme(legends = TRUE)
```

- However, in this case, I think we need a legend because there are many **classes**.

### Positive relationship between x- and y-axes {-}

- Let's plot another scatterplot using **mtcars** data. 
- Set the x-axis with **drat** and y-axis with **mpg**.
- Since you are making a scatterplot, you will need to use `geom_point()`.
- Set the **size** of all points to **3** by typing `size = 3`. 
- Set the **shape** of all points to the circle with a border by typing `shape = 21`.
- Set the **filled color** of all points to **green** by typing `fill = '#0f993d'`.
- Set the **border color** to **white** by typing `color = 'white'`. 
  - Since `shape = 21` refers to the circle with a border, `fill` is the color that fills the points and `color` is the border color.

```{r,fig.width = 3.7, fig.height=3.7}
ggplot(data = mtcars, mapping = aes(x = drat, y = mpg)) +
  geom_point(shape = 21, fill = '#0f993d', color = 'white',
             size = 3) 
```

- **drat** and **mpg** have a positive relationship.

- Now let's make it pretty by adding `sm_corr_theme()`. 

```{r,fig.width = 3.7,fig.height=3.7}
ggplot(data = mtcars, mapping = aes(x = drat, y = mpg)) +
  geom_point(shape = 21, fill = '#0f993d', color = 'white', size = 3) + 
  sm_corr_theme()
```

- You can remove borders too by setting `borders = FALSE` in `sm_corr_theme()`.

```{r,fig.width = 3.7,fig.height=3.7}
ggplot(data = mtcars, mapping = aes(x = drat, y = mpg)) +
  geom_point(shape = 21, fill = '#0f993d', color = 'white', size = 3) + 
  sm_corr_theme(borders = FALSE)
```


### Reporting statistics from a paired correlation {-}

- **smplot** also offers a function that plots the best-fit line of a scatterplot (i.e., correlation plot) and prints statistical values, such as p- and R-values.
  - p-value is used to check for statistical significance. If it's less than 0.05, its regarded as **statistically significant**. However, it gets smaller with a larger sample size.
  - R-value (correlation coefficient) measures the strength and the direction of the correlation. It ranges from -1 to 1. It does not depend on the sample size. 
- Let's add a function `sm_statCorr()`. The statistical results are from Pearson's correlation test. 

```{r,fig.width = 3.7, fig.height=3.7, warning = F}
ggplot(data = mtcars, mapping = aes(x = drat, y = mpg)) +
  geom_point(shape = 21, fill = '#0f993d', color = 'white', size = 3) + sm_corr_theme() + 
  sm_statCorr()
```

- I don't really like how the line color is different from that of the points. Let's change the color to green.
- Also let's get results from Spearman's correlation test rather than from Pearson's. 
  - To do so, type `corr_method = 'spearman'` in the function `sm_statCorr()`. You will get a different **R** value from 0.68, which is from Pearson's correlation test.

```{r,fig.width = 3.7, fig.height=3.7, warning = F}
ggplot(data = mtcars, mapping = aes(x = drat, y = mpg)) +
  geom_point(shape = 21, fill = '#0f993d', color = 'white', size = 3) + 
  sm_corr_theme() + 
  sm_statCorr(color = '#0f993d', corr_method = 'spearman')
```

- **Exercise**: Set `corr_method = 'pearson'`and see what happens.

```{r, eval = F}
ggplot(data = mtcars, aes(x = drat, y = mpg)) +
  geom_point(shape = 21, fill = '#0f993d', color = 'white', size = 3) + 
  sm_corr_theme() + 
  sm_statCorr(color = '#0f993d', corr_method = 'pearson')
```

- You will see that this is exactly the same as when `corr_method` argument is not included in `sm_statCorr()`. In short, the **default** correlation method for `sm_statCorr()` is `'pearson'`. So, if you don't write anything for `corr_method`, it will give results from Pearson's correlation test. Type `?sm_statCorr` to see the default of `line_type`.

- `#0f993d` is a specific green that I like. 
- Now, let's change the color. Replace `'#0f993d'` with `'green'` in `geom_point()` and `sm_statCorr`.
  - This `'green'` is the default green color of **R**.

```{r,fig.width = 3.7, fig.height=3.7, warning = F}
ggplot(data = mtcars, mapping = aes(x = drat, y = mpg)) +
  geom_point(shape = 21, fill = 'green', color = 'white', size = 3) + sm_corr_theme() + 
  sm_statCorr(color = 'green')
```

- Which one do you prefer?

### `fill = '#0f993d'` vs `fill = 'green'` {-}

- I personally like `#0f993d` more. However, **R** does not recognize this color as `green`.
- So how are you supposed to remember the color code?
- You do not have to. You can type `sm_color('green')` instead. This is a function from the **smplot** package.
- `sm_color()` accepts the name of the color. If you want to get the hex codes (color codes) for red and green, type `sm_color('red','green')`.

```{r, eval = F}
sm_color('red','green')
```

- Again, `sm_color()` has been built based on my preference. So it returns the hex codes of colors that I use most often. 
- There are many more color themes that are available in R. For more information, please check out Chapter 28 of *R for Data Science* (https://r4ds.had.co.nz/graphics-for-communication.html).


```{r,fig.width = 3.7, fig.height=3.7, warning = F}
ggplot(data = mtcars, mapping = aes(x = drat, y = mpg)) +
  geom_point(shape = 21, fill = sm_color('green'), color = 'white',size = 3) + 
  sm_corr_theme() + 
  sm_statCorr(color = sm_color('green'))
```

- **Exercise** Change the color of the points and the best-fit line to `blue` using `sm_color()`. If you want to see all the color options for `sm_color()`, type `?sm_color`. There are 16 colors total.

```{r, eval = F}
ggplot(data = mtcars, mapping = aes(x = drat, y = mpg)) +
  geom_point(shape = 21, fill = sm_color('blue'), color = 'white',size = 3) + 
  sm_corr_theme() + 
  sm_statCorr(color = sm_color('blue'))
```

### Different color for each group but with other colors {-}

- Let's go back to the **mpg** data. Set the x-axis with **displ** and y-axis with **hwy**. Then make a scatterplot using `geom_point()`.
  - Set the size of the points to 2 across all groups. So type `size = 2` outside of `aes()` in `geom_point()`.
- Let's apply different color for each `class` of the cars by writing `color = class` in `aes()` from `ggplot()`.
  - `fill = class` is needed when the shape of the point is set to 21-25.

```{r, fig.width = 5.2, fig.height = 3.7, warning = F}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = class)) + 
  geom_point(size = 2)
```

- To use other colors, we could use a function from **ggplot2** called `scale_color_manual()`.
  - `scale_fill_manual()` is used when the shape of the point has borders (shape = 21-25).
- To find how many colors we need total, we need to find how many groups exist.

```{r}
unique_classes <- unique(mpg$class)
```

- In R, you can extract data from one column by using `$`. You can try it with different variables too.
- `unique()` returns unique values in the selected data.
- Then compute the number of unique values using `length()` function.

```{r}
number_of_classes <- length(unique_classes)
number_of_classes
```

- `sm_palette` accepts the number of colors as input. It returns colors that I use most often.
- Now that we know we need 7 colors total, we can type `sm_palette(7)` or `sm_palette(number_of_classes)` for `values` in `scale_color_manual()`.
  
  
```{r, fig.width = 5.2, fig.height = 3.7, warning = F}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = class)) + 
  geom_point(size = 2) + 
  scale_color_manual(values = sm_palette(number_of_classes)) + 
  sm_corr_theme()
```

- Let's store this graph using a **variable** called `figure1`. 

```{r, eval = F}
figure1 <- ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = class)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  scale_color_manual(values = sm_palette(number_of_classes)) + 
  sm_corr_theme()

ggplot(data = mpg) # make your graph disappear
figure1 # it will appear again by calling this variable 
```

 - Now you will able to call forth the graph just by calling the **figure1** variable in the console.
 
### Let's save the plot as an image in your folder **LearnR** by using the variable **figure1**. {-}
 
- To save the figure as an image, we will use a function from the **cowplot** package. 
- The function is `save_plot()`. 
- There is one important argument: `base_asp`. 
  - This is the ratio of your image (width/height). I usually set it to 1.4. So let's type `base_asp = 1.4` in `save_plot()`.
  - If `base_asp` is larger than 1, it gets wider than its height. This is recommended when you have a legend.
  - If there is no legend, then `base_asp = 1` is recommended.
  
 ```{r, eval = F}
 save_plot('figure1.png', figure1, base_asp = 1.4)
 ```
 
- **Exercise**: try to save it again with a name **figure1b.png** by typing:

```{r, eval = F}
save_plot('figure1b.png', figure1)
```

- How's the picture? Why does it look different? Type `?save_plot` to see what the default `base_asp` is.

- Done! The graph (in png file) should be in your **LearnR** folder. 
- **Exercise:**  Try to open Microsoft Word or PowerPoint and upload **figure1**. The figure should look the same as it appears in the slides.
- **Exercise:** Remove the legend and save the scatterplot with `base_asp = 1`. 

- Congratulations! You can now make **correlation plots** with R.

## Summary 

- You have learned the basics of **ggplot**. 
  - You begin by writing a `ggplot()` function.
  - If aesthetics (color, shape, etc) are specified outside of `aes()` function, then there is no group difference.
  - If aesthetics are specified in `aes()`, different groups of data will have different looks.
  - You have learned to add geom layers such as `geom_point()`, which shows points, and `geom_smooth()`, which plots the best-fit function.
  - You have learned to plot `geom_point()` and `geom_smooth()` in the same graph.

- **smplot** functions can be used to improve **ggplot2** visually.
  - For correlation plots, add `sm_corr_theme()`.
  - You can report statistical results and plot linear regression from correlation by `sm_statCorr()`.
  - You can also select colors using `sm_color()`.
  
- Save the graph as an image file in your working directory.
  - Working directory has to be set in RStudio (**Session -> Set Working Directory -> Choose Directory**)
  - Then use `save_plot()` from **cowplot** to save the image in your directory (folder **LearnR**).
