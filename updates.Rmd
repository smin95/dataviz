# Opening Remarks
```{r,fig.align = 'left', out.width='35%',echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("smplot2_hex.png")
```

**smplot2**'s key contributions are shortcut functions that generate elegant plots, which are aesthetically appropriate for the format of scientific journals, and key functions that can create and annotate a composite figure (subplotting), the latter of which is described in Chapter 7 in detail. 

## Which sections to read

If you are a proficient R user, I suggest that you read Chapters 7 (sections 7.4-7.7), 11 and 12 because all other sections describe basics of R as well.

Chapters 8-10 describe some introductory topics of data analysis that I often use in my research, and they have been written for the students that I supervise. Although the chapters might be useful for those in psychology and medicine, these do not discuss about data visualization. 

If you are a **smplot** user, you can either use its tutorial website (https://www.smin95.com/dataviz0) and continue to use **smplot** or modify your codes so that it works with **smplot2**. If you decide to use **smplot2**, I suggest you that you delete **smplot**. Also, I suggest that you read Chapters 11 (especially the sub-section: How `...` parameter and `xxx.params` work) and 12 to understand the changes that have been made to the new package rather than to read the book from the beginning.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
remove.packages("smplot")
```

If you are a newcomer, then you can just start reading from the next chapter.
