This book outlines tutorials in using ggplot2 in R coupled with smplot, a package developed by myself. Since smplot is a package for newcomers to R, I have decided to combine ggplot2 tutorials and documentation of smplot together.

## For those who are familiar with R & ggplot2 already {-}

Please skip Chapter 1-3.
