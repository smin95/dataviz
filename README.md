## Frequently Asked Questions
**1\. Why did you create the smplot R package?
Actually, I created it because I had become too tired of manually tweaking the defaults of ggplot2 all the time. I had also developd my own style for data visualization. I wanted to automate the process to make it easier for myself, and I decided later to make a guide for the public and future students.

**2\. Is the smplot package available on CRAN yet?
No. But I plan to submit it to CRAN in the future.

**3\. Can I use the smplot package to plot data with base R?
No. It only complements ggplot2. So users of smplot is assumed to be using ggplot2 for data visualization.
