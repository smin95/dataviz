# Data Analysis (in development)

This section is in development. Contents will include dplyr (filter, select) and statistics (t-test, correlation, power analysis etc).

If you wish me to include other topics, please let me know. 

## `filter` for data, `select` for columns


```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

First, you need to load data (.csv file). When you are loading your own .csv file for your data analysis, make sure you place the .csv file of your interest in the folder that has been set to the **working directory**. 

In this example, we will be using data from this paper:

**Seung Hyun Min, Alex S. Baldwin and Robert F. Hess. Ocular dominance plasticity: A binocular combination task finds no cumulative effect with repeated patching (2019). Vision Research, 161, 36-42.**

We will be creating a similar figure to **Figure 2A** using **smplot**. For the PDF copy, please visit https://www.smin95.com/pubs/min2019.pdf. 

```{r}
df <- read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/smin95/dataviz/master/min2019.csv')
df$Day <- factor(df$Day)
head(df)
```

There are 4 columns in this dataframe:

- First, `Subject` refers to each participant. There are 10 participants total. 

- Next, `Day` refers to the day of testing. The participants were tested on Day 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5. We will only use Day from 1 and 5.

- `Time` refers to the number of minutes after an experimental manipulation (ex. monocular deprivation). These are 0, 3, 6, 12, 24 and 48 minutes, but in the dataframe, it says 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5; we will change the labels manually. 

- The `Cbratio` column refers to the actual data that will be plotted here.  

In the example below, the plots will have different colors based on Day (1 or 5). Therefore, the values in `Day` column have to be discrete, not continuous. To make them discrte, one needs to convert the `Day` column from **double** (continuous variable) to **factor** (discrete variable).

To plot data of each subject separately, we need the dataframe to show data only from one subject. This can be achieved as shown below:

```{r}
df %>% filter(Subject == 'S1')
```

`%>%` is called the **pipe**. The above code can be read as: **filter** for all rows of the dataframe **df** that have `S1` in the `Subject` column. 

Here is another example. 

```{r}
df %>% filter(Day == 1)
```

The above code can be read as: **filter** for all rows of the dataframe **df** that have `1` in the `Day` column.

Notice that S1 is a **character** because it has an alphabet. Therefore, it needs to be written as `'S1'`. However, `1` of `Day` is **double**, which is essentially just a number digit. Therefore, it can be written as `1` with no quotation mark. 

Let's try another example.

```{r}
df %>% filter(Day == 1) %>% filter(Subject == 'S1')
```

The above code can be read as: **filter** for all rows of the dataframe **df** that have `1` in the `Day` column. Then, **filter** for all rows of the dataframe **df** that have `S1` in the `Subject` column. 

The above can also be written like the one below:

```{r}
df %>% filter(Day == 1 & Subject == 'S1') 
```

The above can be read as: **filter** for all rows of the dataframe **df** that have `1` in the `Day` column **AND** have `S1` in the `Subject` column.

```{r}
df %>% filter(Day == 1 | Subject == 'S1') 
```

The above can be read as: **filter** for all rows of the dataframe **df** that have `1` in the `Day` column **OR** have `S1` in the `Subject` column.

If you wish to see the `Cbratio` column only (i.e., data only) for rows of **df** that have `Day ==  1` and `Time == 0`, you can write it like this:

```{r}
df %>% filter(Day == 1 & Time == 0) %>% select(Cbratio)
```

There are 10 rows (i.e., 10 subjects) in this filtered data frame and 1 column, which is `Cbratio`. The above can be read as: **filter** for all rows of the dataframe **df** that have `1` in the `Day` column **AND** have `0` in the `Time` column.

## Plotting individual data

First, you will need several packages for this section. 

- If you do not have the **gridExtra** and **grid** packages in your RStudio, please install them using the codes below. It might take less than a minute. 

```{r, eval = F}
install.packages('gridExtra')
install.packages('grid')
```

- Then load all these packages below. 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(cowplot)
library(smplot)
library(gridExtra)
library(grid)
```

Now let's plot data for each subject (S1-S9) except S10. Each panel shows the data of each subject for both Days 1 and 5. 

```{r, fig.width = 3.65, fig.height = 3.65}
df_s1 <- df %>% filter(Subject == 'S1') 
# rows of df that only contain S1 in the Subject column

# use df_s1 to plot the data of S1

plot_s1 <- ggplot(data = df_s1, aes(x = Time, y = Cbratio, color = Day)) + 
  geom_point(size = 4.5) +
  geom_smooth(method = 'lm', se = F, size = 0.9) + 
  # lm = linear regression method 
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = unique(df$Time), 
                     labels = c("0", "3", "6", "12", "24", "48")) +
  sm_hgrid() +
  scale_color_manual(values = sm_color('blue','orange')) +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(-3, 5.5)) +
  theme(axis.text = element_text(size = rel(1.5), color = "black")) 
# axis text size is 1.5x the original font size. 

print(plot_s1)
```

Then make each one for the other subjects (S2-S9). 

```{r, fig.width = 3.65, fig.height = 3.65}
df_s2 <- df %>% filter(Subject == 'S2') 

plot_s2 <- ggplot(data = df_s2, aes(x = Time, y = Cbratio, color = Day)) + 
  geom_point(size = 4.5) +
  geom_smooth(method = 'lm', se = F, size = 0.9) + 
  # lm = linear regression method 
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = unique(df$Time), 
                     labels = c("0", "3", "6", "12", "24", "48")) +
  sm_hgrid() +
  scale_color_manual(values = sm_color('blue','orange')) +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(-3, 5.5)) +
  theme(axis.text = element_text(size = rel(1.5), color = "black")) 
# axis text size is 1.5x the original font size. 

print(plot_s2)
```

```{r, fig.width = 3.65, fig.height = 3.65}
df_s3 <- df %>% filter(Subject == 'S3')

plot_s3 <- ggplot(data = df_s3, aes(x = Time, y = Cbratio, color = Day)) + 
  geom_point(size = 4.5) +
  geom_smooth(method = 'lm', se = F, size = 0.9) + 
  # lm = linear regression method 
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = unique(df$Time), 
                     labels = c("0", "3", "6", "12", "24", "48")) +
  sm_hgrid() +
  scale_color_manual(values = sm_color('blue','orange')) +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(-3, 5.5)) +
  theme(axis.text = element_text(size = rel(1.5), color = "black")) 
# axis text size is 1.5x the original font size. 

print(plot_s3)
```

```{r, fig.width = 3.65, fig.height = 3.65}
df_s4 <- df %>% filter(Subject == 'S4')

plot_s4 <- ggplot(data = df_s4, aes(x = Time, y = Cbratio, color = Day)) + 
  geom_point(size = 4.5) +
  geom_smooth(method = 'lm', se = F, size = 0.9) + 
  # lm = linear regression method 
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = unique(df$Time), 
                     labels = c("0", "3", "6", "12", "24", "48")) +
  sm_hgrid() +
  scale_color_manual(values = sm_color('blue','orange')) +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(-3, 5.5)) +
  theme(axis.text = element_text(size = rel(1.5), color = "black")) 
# axis text size is 1.5x the original font size. 

print(plot_s4)
```

```{r, fig.width = 3.65, fig.height = 3.65}
# Subject 5
df_s5 <- df %>% filter(Subject == 'S5') 
# rows of df that only contain S5 in the Subject column

plot_s5 <- ggplot(data = df_s5, aes(x = Time, y = Cbratio, color = Day)) + 
  geom_point(size = 4.5) +
  geom_smooth(method = 'lm', se = F, size = 0.9) + 
  # lm = linear regression method 
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = unique(df$Time), 
                     labels = c("0", "3", "6", "12", "24", "48")) +
  sm_hgrid(legends = TRUE) + # show legends for the color
  scale_color_manual(values = sm_color('blue','orange')) +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(-3, 5.5)) +
  theme(axis.text = element_text(size = rel(1.5), color = "black")) + # axis text size is 1.5x the original font size. 
  theme(legend.justification = c(1,0), 
        legend.position = c(0.96, 0.65)) 
# location of legend (color label)

print(plot_s5)
```

```{r, fig.width = 3.65, fig.height = 3.65}
# Subject 6
df_s6 <- df %>% filter(Subject == 'S6') 
# rows of df that only contain S6 in the Subject column

plot_s6 <- ggplot(data = df_s5, aes(x = Time, y = Cbratio, color = Day)) + 
  geom_point(size = 4.5) +
  geom_smooth(method = 'lm', se = F, size = 0.9) + 
  # lm = linear regression method 
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = unique(df$Time), 
                     labels = c("0", "3", "6", "12", "24", "48")) +

# axis text size is 1.5x the original font size. 

print(plot_s6)
```

```{r, fig.width = 3.65, fig.height = 3.65}
df_s7 <- df %>% filter(Subject == 'S7')

plot_s7 <- ggplot(data = df_s7, aes(x = Time, y = Cbratio, color = Day)) + 
  geom_point(size = 4.5) +
  geom_smooth(method = 'lm', se = F, size = 0.9) +

# axis text size is 1.5x the original font size. 

print(plot_s7)
```

```{r, fig.width = 3.65, fig.height = 3.65}
df_s8 <- df %>% filter(Subject == 'S8')

plot_s8 <- ggplot(data = df_s8, aes(x = Time, y = Cbratio, color = Day)) + 
  geom_point(size = 4.5) +
  geom_smooth(method = 'lm', se = F, size = 0.9) + 
  # lm = linear regression method 
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = unique(df$Time), 
                     labels = c("0", "3", "6", "12", "24", "48")) +
  sm_hgrid() +
  scale_color_manual(values = sm_color('blue','orange')) +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(-3, 5.5)) +
  theme(axis.text = element_text(size = rel(1.5), color = "black")) 
# axis text size is 1.5x the original font size. 

print(plot_s8)
```

```{r, fig.width = 3.65, fig.height = 3.65}
# Subject 9

df_s9 <- df %>% filter(Subject == 'S9') 

plot_s9 <- ggplot(data = df_s9, aes(x = Time, y = Cbratio, color = Day)) +

  theme(axis.text = element_text(size = rel(1.5), color = "black"))
# axis text size is 1.5x the original font size. 

print(plot_s9)
```

Now let's put them together in a 3x3 figure (3 rows, 3 columns) using the function `plot_grid` from the **cowplot** package. Here is the illustration of what we are going to do. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align = 'center',fig.cap="3x3 figure. It has 3 columns and 3 rows", out.width = '75%'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/rc33.png")
```

When you are saving the graph as an image file, `nrow` and `ncol` in `save_plot()` have to match the values in `plot_grid()` as shown below. 

`plot_grid()` is a function that puts different graphs together (ex. 3x3 structure).

`save_plot()` is a function that saves a selected graph into an image or PDF file (or eps, etc).  

```{r, fig.width = 11.4, fig.height = 11.6}

together1 <- plot_grid(plot_s1, plot_s2, plot_s3,
                       plot_s4, plot_s5, plot_s6, 
                       plot_s7, plot_s8, plot_s9, 
          ncol = 3, # 2 columns in the final figure
          nrow = 3, # 2 rows in the final figure 
          align = 'hv',# set to the same horizontal and vertical                             # lengths of each panel. 
          labels = c('S1','S2', 'S3', 'S4','S5','S6',
                     'S7','S8','S9'), # each panel label
          label_x = 0.14,# horizontal position of the panel's 
          # label relative to each panel. 0 is the very 
          # left of the plot.
          label_y = 0.97)  # vertical position of the panel's 
          # label relative to each panel. 1 is the very 
          # top of the plot. 

print(together1)

save_plot('together1.png',together1,nrow=3,ncol=3,base_asp=0.95) 
# save as an image. ncol and nrow in save_plot() 
# nrow and ncol in save_plot() have to match the values in plot_grid() as shown above. 
```

Open `together1.png` in your directory folder. Notice that the **png** file may look different from the one printed in your RStudio screen or on the browser as shown in this guide. As long as your **png** file looks good, it should be okay. 

Note that are some repeating x and y-axes labels. We can remove them. For instance, the top left panel's x-axis labels can be removed because the bottom left panel also has the x-axis labels. 

Another instance is that the y-axis labels of the top right panel can be removed because the top left panel has the same label. 

Also, it seems that there are some empty space between amongst panel. Let's remove them by reducing the margin of each panel. For more information about the function `plot_grid`, please type `?plot_grid` in the console.

- We will use the function `sm_common_axis()` to resolve these issues.

- `sm_common_axis()` has an argument called `location`. This refers to the location of each panel in the combined figure that you will make. 

- The picture here illustrates what you will need to write for `location` in the function `sm_common_axis()`. 

- Example: `sm_common_axis(location = 'topleft')` for the very top left panel of the 3x3 combined figure.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align = 'center',fig.cap="Arguments for location in sm_common_axis for 3x3 figure.", out.width = '75%'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/rc_arg.png")
```



```{r, fig.width = 11.1, fig.height = 11.3}

plot_s1_b <- plot_s1 + sm_common_axis(location = 'topleft')

plot_s2_b <- plot_s2 + sm_common_axis(location = 'topcenter')

plot_s3_b <- plot_s1 + sm_common_axis(location = 'topright')

plot_s4_b <- plot_s4 + sm_common_axis(location = 'topleft')

plot_s5_b <- plot_s5 + sm_common_axis(location = 'topcenter')

plot_s6_b <- plot_s6 + sm_common_axis(location = 'topright')

plot_s7_b <- plot_s7 + sm_common_axis(location = 'bottomleft')

plot_s8_b <- plot_s1 + sm_common_axis(location = 'bottomcenter')

plot_s9_b <- plot_s9 + sm_common_axis(location = 'bottomright')

together2 <- plot_grid(plot_s1_b, plot_s2_b, plot_s3_b,
                       plot_s4_b, plot_s5_b, plot_s6_b, 
                       plot_s7_b, plot_s8_b, plot_s9_b, 
          ncol = 3, # 2 columns in the final figure
          nrow = 3, # 2 rows in the final figure 
          align = 'hv',# set to the same horizontal and vertical 
          # lengths of each panel. 
          labels = c('S1','S2', 'S3', 'S4','S5','S6',
                     'S7','S8','S9'), # each panel label
          label_x = 0.07) # horizontal position of the panel's 
                          # label relative to each panel. 
                          # 0 is the very left of the plot. 

print(together2)

save_plot('together2.png',together2,nrow=3,ncol=3,base_asp=0.95)
# save as an image. ncol and nrow in save_plot() 
# nrow and ncol in save_plot() have to match the 
# values in plot_grid() as shown above. 
```

Open `together2.png` in your directory folder. I think it looks a lot cleaner!

If you are planning to make 1x3 figure (1 row, 3 columns), here is the illustration.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align = 'center',fig.cap="Arguments for location in sm_common_axis for 1x3 figure.", out.width = '75%'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/rc13.png")
```

If you are planning to make 2x2 figure (2 rows, 2 columns), here is the illustration.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align = 'center',fig.cap="Arguments for location in sm_common_axis for 2x2 figure.", out.width = '55%'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/rc22.png")
```

We are almost done now. You need to add the y-axis label (`'Contrast balance ratio'`), x-axis label (`'Minutes after monocular deprivation'`) and the title (`'Recovery of the patching effect'`) as shown in the original paper (Vision Research 2019).

You can do this in **Adobe Illustrator** or directly in **R**. Here, I present a solution with **R**.

You don't have to understand the codes below to use the codes.

```{r, fig.width = 11.5, fig.height = 12.5}

title <- ggdraw() + 
  draw_label('Recovery of the patching effect',
                               size = 17, hjust = 0.45, vjust = 1.2) # title of the combined plot. 
# vjust controls the vertical position of the title. 
# hjust controls the horizontal position of the title.

plot_with_title <- plot_grid(title, together2, ncol = 1, 
                             rel_heights = c(0.1 ,1)) 
# add the title and the combined plot together 

combined_plot <- add_sub(plot_with_title, 
                         "Minutes after monocular deprivation", 
                         y = 0, vjust = -.3, size = 17) 
# add x-axis title to the combined plot

# add y-axis title to the combined plot
combined_plot <- grid.arrange(combined_plot, left = textGrob("\u0394 Contrast Balance Ratio (dB)", gp = gpar(fontsize = 17), rot = 90))


save_plot("combined_plot.png", combined_plot, ncol = 3, nrow = 3,
          base_aspect_ratio = .9, limitsize = F)
```

Open `combined_plot.png` file in your directory folder. Does it look similar to the one in the web browser? On my computer, they look very different, and I much prefer the **png** file. 

To be honest, for adding the titles of the axes and the graph, using **Adobe Illustrator** might be much easier. I just included the codes here to demonstrate that everything, however, can be done in R.

If you do not understand some of these functions, you can type in your console `?add_sub`, `?grid.arrange` to learn about these functions.

An astute reader will realize that the codes are quite repetitive. Could the codes be shortened? The answer is yes! However, this method is quite complex and is beyond the scope of this book.
