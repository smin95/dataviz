# Data Analysis (in development)

This section is in development. Contents will include dplyr (filter, select) and statistics (t-test, correlation, power analysis etc).

If you wish me to include other topics, please let me know. 

## `filter` for data, `select` for columns


```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

First, you need to load data (.csv file). When you are loading your own .csv file for your data analysis, make sure you place the .csv file of your interest in the folder that has been set to the **working directory**. 

In this example, we will be using data from this paper:

**Seung Hyun Min, Alex S. Baldwin and Robert F. Hess. Ocular dominance plasticity: A binocular combination task finds no cumulative effect with repeated patching (2019). Vision Research, 161, 36-42.**

We will be creating a similar figure to **Figure 2A** using **smplot**. For the PDF copy, please visit https://www.smin95.com/pubs/min2019.pdf. 

```{r}
df <- read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/smin95/dataviz/master/min2019.csv')
df$Day <- factor(df$Day)
head(df)
```

There are 4 columns in this dataframe:

- First, `Subject` refers to each participant. There are 10 participants total. 

- Next, `Day` refers to the day of testing. The participants were tested on Day 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5. We will only use Day from 1 and 5.

- `Time` refers to the number of minutes after an experimental manipulation (ex. monocular deprivation). These are 0, 3, 6, 12, 24 and 48 minutes, but in the dataframe, it says 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5; we will change the labels manually. 

- The `Cbratio` column refers to the actual data that will be plotted here.  

In the example below, the plots will have different colors based on Day (1 or 5). Therefore, the values in `Day` column have to be discrete, not continuous. To make them discrete, one needs to convert the `Day` column from **double** (continuous variable) to **factor** (discrete variable).

To plot data of each subject separately, we need the dataframe to show data only from one subject. This can be achieved as shown below:

```{r}
df %>% filter(Subject == 'S1')
```

`%>%` is called the **pipe**. The above code can be read as: **filter** for all rows of the dataframe **df** that have `S1` in the `Subject` column. 

Here is another example. 

```{r}
df %>% filter(Day == 1)
```

The above code can be read as: **filter** for all rows of the dataframe **df** that have `1` in the `Day` column.

Notice that S1 is a **character** because it has an alphabet. Therefore, it needs to be written as `'S1'`. However, `1` of `Day` is **double**, which is essentially just a number digit. Therefore, it can be written as `1` with no quotation mark. 

Let's try another example.

```{r}
df %>% filter(Day == 1) %>% filter(Subject == 'S1')
```

The above code can be read as: **filter** for all rows of the dataframe **df** that have `1` in the `Day` column. Then, **filter** for all rows of the dataframe **df** that have `S1` in the `Subject` column. 

The above can also be written like the one below:

```{r}
df %>% filter(Day == 1 & Subject == 'S1') 
```

The above can be read as: **filter** for all rows of the dataframe **df** that have `1` in the `Day` column **AND** have `S1` in the `Subject` column.

```{r}
df %>% filter(Day == 1 | Subject == 'S1') 
```

The above can be read as: **filter** for all rows of the dataframe **df** that have `1` in the `Day` column **OR** have `S1` in the `Subject` column.

If you wish to see the `Cbratio` column only (i.e., data only) for rows of **df** that have `Day ==  1` and `Time == 0`, you can write it like this:

```{r}
df %>% filter(Day == 1 & Time == 0) %>% select(Cbratio)
```

There are 10 rows (i.e., 10 subjects) in this filtered data frame and 1 column, which is `Cbratio`. The above can be read as: **filter** for all rows of the dataframe **df** that have `1` in the `Day` column **AND** have `0` in the `Time` column.

If you are interested in learning more about this topic, please check out Chapter 5 of R for Data Science by Hadley Wickham (https://r4ds.had.co.nz/transform.html).

## Basic statistics

We will use the **df** dataset for this example to demonstrate t-test, effect size and power analysis.

```{r}
head(df)
```

### T-test

In this example, we will compare changes in sensory eye dominance after short-term monocular deprivation in Day 1 vs Day 5. These values are shown in the `Cbratio` column.

Let's filter only for data that are `Time == 0` for Day 1 and Day 5, which refers to 0 minutes after short-term monocular deprivation for 120 minutes. 

```{r}
# 0 minutes after short-term monocular deprivation 
df_0min <- df %>% filter(Time == 0)
```

Now, let's plot a bar graph to display contrast balance ratio (`Cbratio`) from Days 1 and 5 at 0 minutes after short-term monocular deprivation using `sm_bar()`.

```{r, fig.width = 3.7, fig.height=3.7, warning = F}
ggplot(data = df_0min, mapping = aes(x = Day, y = Cbratio, fill = Day)) +
  sm_bar(shape = 21, color = 'white', bar_fill_color = 'gray80') +
  scale_fill_manual(values = sm_color('blue','orange')) +
  ggtitle('Cbratio at 0min')
```

There seems to be a very small difference in the contrast balance ratio (`Cbratio`) between Days 1 and 5. The errorbars (in this case, standard error) are overlapping; this indicates that there is no significant difference (p < 0.05) between the two datasets. Let's take a look if my prediction is correct by using a **t-test** using the function `t.test`.

```{r}
df_0min
```

`t.test` allows us to compare whether data between two different groups are significantly different. Since we will only compare values in the `Cbratio` column, let's select for the `Cbratio` column and use these values in our `t.test`. 

```{r}
df_0min_day1 <- df_0min %>% filter(Day == 1) %>% select(Cbratio)
print(df_0min_day1)
print(df_0min_day1$Cbratio)

df_0min_day5 <- df_0min %>% filter(Day == 5) %>% select(Cbratio)
print(df_0min_day5)

```

Notice that when `df_0min_day1` has a column entitled `Cbratio` with 10 rows of data. However, `df_0min_day1$Cbratio` prints ONLY the values within the `Cbratio` column. This is because `$` is used to **extract** a specific column within a dataframe. You could type `df_0min$` ,  press the **Tab** button from the keyboard, and see what happens. 

```{r}
t.test(df_0min_day1$Cbratio, df_0min_day5$Cbratio, paired = TRUE)
```

In this case, the subjects are **paired** because the 10 subjects performed on both Days 1 and 5. If your data are not paired (ex. patients vs controls) and you want to perform a t-test, you can set `paried = FALSE`. 

If we are reporting the results, we should report it as such, t(9) = -0.35, p = 0.736. The difference between Days 1 and 5 is not significant.

### Effect Size

However, even if p-value is larger than 0.05, this does not mean that there is no significant difference between the two groups.

If the sample size is small, p-value can be larger than 0.05. But as the sample gets larger, p-value will decrease even if the mean difference between the two groups remains the same. 

In this example, the sample size is not large (n=10). Therefore, one might ask whether our conclusion that there is no significant difference between Days 1 and 5 is truly valid.

To respond to this concern, we might need to calculate the **effect size**. If the effect size is large, there is large difference between the sample groups. 

One measure to capture the effect size is **Cohen's d**. We can use `sm_effsize()` to calculate Cohen's d as a measure for the effect size. 

- **Small** effect size: Cohen's d around 0.2 
- **Medium** effect size: Cohen's d around 0.5 
- **Large** effect size: Cohen's d > 0.8.

The inputs for `sm_effsize()` are the data of two sample groups, just as they were in `t.test()`. 


```{r}
sm_effsize(df_0min_day1$Cbratio, df_0min_day5$Cbratio)
```

It is recommended that both p-value and effect size are reported in scientific papers.

### Power Analysis

We got p > 0.05 with our small sample size (n = 10). As we previously mentioned, we know that p-value gets smaller with an increasing sample size. So, one might be concerned with what would be the minimal sample size to detect a statistically significant difference between the two groups (Days 1 and 5). If the minimal sample size is not large, then one can conclude that I did not collect enough data to show the difference and that it was incorrect for me to state that there was no significant difference between the two groups.

To figure out the minimal sample size, we must do **power analysis**. This can be achieved using `sm_power()`. The inputs for `sm_power()` are data of two sample groups, just as they were in `t.test()`.

```{r}
sm_power(df_0min_day1$Cbratio, df_0min_day5$Cbratio, 
         paired = TRUE)
```

We would need **232 subjects** per group (`n = 231.1206`) for the p-value to reach below 0.05 and, therefore, for us to detect a statistically significant difference in contrast balance ratio between Days 1 and 5. In other words, the difference between Days 1 and 5 is very small. Also, the conclusion that there was no difference between the days seems to be valid even though the sample size is small.

To learn more about performing statistical tests in R, please check out the book entitled **YaRrr! The Pirate's Guide to R** by Nathaniel Phillips (https://bookdown.org/ndphillips/YaRrr/).

## Plotting individual data

First, you will need several packages for this section. 

- If you do not have the **gridExtra** and **grid** packages in your RStudio, please install them using the codes below. It might take less than a minute. 

```{r, eval = F}
install.packages('gridExtra')
install.packages('grid')
```

- Then load all these packages below. 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(cowplot)
library(smplot)
library(gridExtra)
library(grid)
```

Now let's plot data for each subject (S1-S9) except S10. Each panel shows the data of each subject for both Days 1 and 5. 

```{r, fig.width = 3.65, fig.height = 3.65}
df_s1 <- df %>% filter(Subject == 'S1') 
# rows of df that only contain S1 in the Subject column

# use df_s1 to plot the data of S1

plot_s1 <- ggplot(data = df_s1, aes(x = Time, y = Cbratio, color = Day)) + 
  geom_point(size = 4.5) +
  geom_smooth(method = 'lm', se = F, size = 0.9) + 
  # lm = linear regression method 
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = unique(df$Time), 
                     labels = c("0", "3", "6", "12", "24", "48")) +
  sm_hgrid() +
  scale_color_manual(values = sm_color('blue','orange')) +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(-3, 5.5)) +
  theme(axis.text = element_text(size = rel(1.5), color = "black")) 
# axis text size is 1.5x the original font size. 

print(plot_s1)
```

Then make each one for the other subjects (S2-S9). 

```{r, fig.width = 3.65, fig.height = 3.65}
df_s2 <- df %>% filter(Subject == 'S2') 

plot_s2 <- ggplot(data = df_s2, aes(x = Time, y = Cbratio, color = Day)) + 
  geom_point(size = 4.5) +
  geom_smooth(method = 'lm', se = F, size = 0.9) + 
  # lm = linear regression method 
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = unique(df$Time), 
                     labels = c("0", "3", "6", "12", "24", "48")) +
  sm_hgrid() +
  scale_color_manual(values = sm_color('blue','orange')) +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(-3, 5.5)) +
  theme(axis.text = element_text(size = rel(1.5), color = "black")) 
# axis text size is 1.5x the original font size. 

print(plot_s2)
```

```{r, fig.width = 3.65, fig.height = 3.65}
df_s3 <- df %>% filter(Subject == 'S3')

plot_s3 <- ggplot(data = df_s3, aes(x = Time, y = Cbratio, color = Day)) + 
  geom_point(size = 4.5) +
  geom_smooth(method = 'lm', se = F, size = 0.9) + 
  # lm = linear regression method 
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = unique(df$Time), 
                     labels = c("0", "3", "6", "12", "24", "48")) +
  sm_hgrid() +
  scale_color_manual(values = sm_color('blue','orange')) +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(-3, 5.5)) +
  theme(axis.text = element_text(size = rel(1.5), color = "black")) 
# axis text size is 1.5x the original font size. 

print(plot_s3)
```

```{r, fig.width = 3.65, fig.height = 3.65}
df_s4 <- df %>% filter(Subject == 'S4')

plot_s4 <- ggplot(data = df_s4, aes(x = Time, y = Cbratio, color = Day)) + 
  geom_point(size = 4.5) +
  geom_smooth(method = 'lm', se = F, size = 0.9) + 
  # lm = linear regression method 
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = unique(df$Time), 
                     labels = c("0", "3", "6", "12", "24", "48")) +
  sm_hgrid() +
  scale_color_manual(values = sm_color('blue','orange')) +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(-3, 5.5)) +
  theme(axis.text = element_text(size = rel(1.5), color = "black")) 
# axis text size is 1.5x the original font size. 

print(plot_s4)
```

```{r, fig.width = 3.65, fig.height = 3.65}
# Subject 5
df_s5 <- df %>% filter(Subject == 'S5') 
# rows of df that only contain S5 in the Subject column

plot_s5 <- ggplot(data = df_s5, aes(x = Time, y = Cbratio, color = Day)) + 
  geom_point(size = 4.5) +
  geom_smooth(method = 'lm', se = F, size = 0.9) + 
  # lm = linear regression method 
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = unique(df$Time), 
                     labels = c("0", "3", "6", "12", "24", "48")) +
  sm_hgrid(legends = TRUE) + # show legends for the color
  scale_color_manual(values = sm_color('blue','orange')) +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(-3, 5.5)) +
  theme(axis.text = element_text(size = rel(1.5), color = "black")) + # axis text size is 1.5x the original font size. 
  theme(legend.justification = c(1,0), 
        legend.position = c(0.96, 0.65)) 
# location of legend (color label)

print(plot_s5)
```

```{r, fig.width = 3.65, fig.height = 3.65}
# Subject 6
df_s6 <- df %>% filter(Subject == 'S6') 
# rows of df that only contain S6 in the Subject column

plot_s6 <- ggplot(data = df_s5, aes(x = Time, y = Cbratio, color = Day)) + 
  geom_point(size = 4.5) +
  geom_smooth(method = 'lm', se = F, size = 0.9) + 
  # lm = linear regression method 
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = unique(df$Time), 
                     labels = c("0", "3", "6", "12", "24", "48")) +
  sm_hgrid() +
  scale_color_manual(values = sm_color('blue','orange')) +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(-3, 5.5))  +
  theme(axis.text = element_text(size = rel(1.5), color = "black")) 
# axis text size is 1.5x the original font size. 

print(plot_s6)
```

```{r, fig.width = 3.65, fig.height = 3.65}
df_s7 <- df %>% filter(Subject == 'S7')

plot_s7 <- ggplot(data = df_s7, aes(x = Time, y = Cbratio, color = Day)) + 
  geom_point(size = 4.5) +
  geom_smooth(method = 'lm', se = F, size = 0.9) + 
  # lm = linear regression method 
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = unique(df$Time), 
                     labels = c("0", "3", "6", "12", "24", "48")) +
  sm_hgrid() +
  scale_color_manual(values = sm_color('blue','orange')) +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(-3, 5.5)) +
  theme(axis.text = element_text(size = rel(1.5), color = "black")) 
# axis text size is 1.5x the original font size. 

print(plot_s7)
```

```{r, fig.width = 3.65, fig.height = 3.65}
df_s8 <- df %>% filter(Subject == 'S8')

plot_s8 <- ggplot(data = df_s8, aes(x = Time, y = Cbratio, color = Day)) + 
  geom_point(size = 4.5) +
  geom_smooth(method = 'lm', se = F, size = 0.9) + 
  # lm = linear regression method 
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = unique(df$Time), 
                     labels = c("0", "3", "6", "12", "24", "48")) +
  sm_hgrid() +
  scale_color_manual(values = sm_color('blue','orange')) +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(-3, 5.5)) +
  theme(axis.text = element_text(size = rel(1.5), color = "black")) 
# axis text size is 1.5x the original font size. 

print(plot_s8)
```

```{r, fig.width = 3.65, fig.height = 3.65}
# Subject 9

df_s9 <- df %>% filter(Subject == 'S9') 

plot_s9 <- ggplot(data = df_s9, aes(x = Time, y = Cbratio, color = Day)) + 
  geom_point(size = 4.5) +
  geom_smooth(method = 'lm', se = F, size = 0.9) + 
  # lm = linear regression method 
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = unique(df$Time), 
                     labels = c("0", "3", "6", "12", "24", "48")) +
  sm_hgrid() +
  scale_color_manual(values = sm_color('blue','orange')) +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(-3, 5.5)) +
  theme(axis.text = element_text(size = rel(1.5), color = "black"))
# axis text size is 1.5x the original font size. 

print(plot_s9)
```

Now let's put them together in a 3x3 figure (3 rows, 3 columns) using the function `plot_grid` from the **cowplot** package. Here is the illustration of what we are going to do. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align = 'center',fig.cap="3x3 figure. It has 3 columns and 3 rows", out.width = '75%'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/rc33.png")
```

When you are saving the graph as an image file, `nrow` and `ncol` in `save_plot()` have to match the values in `plot_grid()` as shown below. 

`plot_grid()` is a function that puts different graphs together (ex. 3x3 structure).

`save_plot()` is a function that saves a selected graph into an image or PDF file (or eps, etc).  

```{r, fig.width = 11.4, fig.height = 11.6}

together1 <- plot_grid(plot_s1, plot_s2, plot_s3,
                       plot_s4, plot_s5, plot_s6, 
                       plot_s7, plot_s8, plot_s9, 
          ncol = 3, # 3 columns in the final figure
          nrow = 3, # 3 rows in the final figure 
          align = 'hv',# set to the same horizontal and vertical                             # lengths of each panel. 
          labels = c('S1','S2', 'S3', 'S4','S5','S6',
                     'S7','S8','S9'), # each panel label
          label_x = 0.14,# horizontal position of the panel's 
          # label relative to each panel. 0 is the very 
          # left of the plot.
          label_y = 0.97)  # vertical position of the panel's 
          # label relative to each panel. 1 is the very 
          # top of the plot. 

print(together1)

save_plot('together1.png',together1,nrow=3,ncol=3,base_asp=0.95) 
# save as an image. ncol and nrow in save_plot() 
# nrow and ncol in save_plot() have to match the values in plot_grid() as shown above. 
```

Open `together1.png` in your directory folder. Notice that the **png** file may look different from the one printed in your RStudio screen or on the browser as shown in this guide. As long as your **png** file looks good, it should be okay. 

Note that are some repeating x and y-axes labels. We can remove them. For instance, the top left panel's x-axis labels can be removed because the bottom left panel also has the x-axis labels. 

Another instance is that the y-axis labels of the top right panel can be removed because the top left panel has the same label. 

Also, it seems that there are some empty space between amongst panel. Let's remove them by reducing the margin of each panel. For more information about the function `plot_grid`, please type `?plot_grid` in the console.

- We will use the function `sm_common_axis()` to resolve these issues.

- `sm_common_axis()` has an argument called `location`. This refers to the location of each panel in the combined figure that you will make. 

- The picture here illustrates what you will need to write for `location` in the function `sm_common_axis()`. 

- Example: `sm_common_axis(location = 'topleft')` for the very top left panel of the 3x3 combined figure.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align = 'center',fig.cap="Arguments for location in sm_common_axis for 3x3 figure.", out.width = '75%'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/rc_arg.png")
```



```{r, fig.width = 11.1, fig.height = 11.3}

plot_s1_b <- plot_s1 + sm_common_axis(location = 'topleft')

plot_s2_b <- plot_s2 + sm_common_axis(location = 'topcenter')

plot_s3_b <- plot_s1 + sm_common_axis(location = 'topright')

plot_s4_b <- plot_s4 + sm_common_axis(location = 'topleft')

plot_s5_b <- plot_s5 + sm_common_axis(location = 'topcenter')

plot_s6_b <- plot_s6 + sm_common_axis(location = 'topright')

plot_s7_b <- plot_s7 + sm_common_axis(location = 'bottomleft')

plot_s8_b <- plot_s1 + sm_common_axis(location = 'bottomcenter')

plot_s9_b <- plot_s9 + sm_common_axis(location = 'bottomright')

together2 <- plot_grid(plot_s1_b, plot_s2_b, plot_s3_b,
                       plot_s4_b, plot_s5_b, plot_s6_b, 
                       plot_s7_b, plot_s8_b, plot_s9_b, 
          ncol = 3, # 3 columns in the final figure
          nrow = 3, # 3 rows in the final figure 
          align = 'hv',# set to the same horizontal and vertical 
          # lengths of each panel. 
          labels = c('S1','S2', 'S3', 'S4','S5','S6',
                     'S7','S8','S9'), # each panel label
          label_x = 0.07) # horizontal position of the panel's 
                          # label relative to each panel. 
                          # 0 is the very left of the plot. 

print(together2)

save_plot('together2.png',together2,nrow=3,ncol=3,base_asp=0.95)
# save as an image. ncol and nrow in save_plot() 
# nrow and ncol in save_plot() have to match the 
# values in plot_grid() as shown above. 
```

Open `together2.png` in your directory folder. I think it looks a lot cleaner!

If you are planning to make a 1x3 figure (1 row, 3 columns), here is the illustration.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align = 'center',fig.cap="Arguments for location in sm_common_axis for 1x3 figure.", out.width = '75%'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/rc13.png")
```

If you are planning to make a 2x2 figure (2 rows, 2 columns), here is the illustration.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align = 'center',fig.cap="Arguments for location in sm_common_axis for 2x2 figure.", out.width = '55%'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/rc22.png")
```

We are almost done now. You need to add the y-axis label (`'Contrast balance ratio'`), x-axis label (`'Minutes after monocular deprivation'`) and the title (`'Recovery of the patching effect'`) as shown in the original paper (Vision Research 2019).

You can do this in **Adobe Illustrator** or directly in **R**. Here, I present a solution with **R**.

You don't have to understand the codes below to use the codes.

```{r, fig.width = 11.5, fig.height = 12.5}

title <- ggdraw() + 
  draw_label('Recovery of the patching effect',
                               size = 17, hjust = 0.45, vjust = 1.2) # title of the 3x3 figure. 
# vjust controls the vertical position of the title. 
# hjust controls the horizontal position of the title.

plot_with_title <- plot_grid(title, together2, ncol = 1, 
                             rel_heights = c(0.1 ,1)) 
# add the title and the 3x3 figure together 

combined_plot <- add_sub(plot_with_title, 
                         "Minutes after monocular deprivation", 
                         y = 0, vjust = -.3, size = 17) 
# add x-axis title to the 3x3 figure

# add y-axis title to the 3x3 figure
combined_plot <- grid.arrange(combined_plot, 
                              left = textGrob("\u0394 Contrast Balance Ratio (dB)",
                                              gp = gpar(fontsize = 17), 
                                              rot = 90))

save_plot("combined_plot.png", combined_plot, ncol = 3, nrow = 3,
          base_aspect_ratio = .9, limitsize = F)
```

Open `combined_plot.png` file in your directory folder. Does it look similar to the one in the web browser? On my computer, they look very different, and I much prefer the **png** file. 

To be honest, for adding the titles of the axes and the graph, using **Adobe Illustrator** might be much easier. I just included the codes here to demonstrate that everything, however, can be done in R.

If you do not understand some of these functions, you can type in your console `?add_sub`, `?grid.arrange` to learn about these functions.

An astute reader will realize that the codes are quite repetitive. Could the codes be shortened? The answer is yes! However, this method is quite complex and is beyond the scope of this book.
